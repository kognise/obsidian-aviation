# Obsidian Aviation

The most comprehensive (and I think only) Obsidian toolkit for aviation-related topics. Includes up-to-date copies of Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR), Aeronautical Information Manual (AIM), and the Pilot/Controller Glossary with more coming soon. This makes it a lot easier to consume and jump around in. This is a huge improvement over the past where you had to either own a physical copy, navigate cumbersome government websites, or find a good PDF.

Every reference to a different paragraph or section has been linked and is easily clickable to jump to that location or open it in a new pane. This makes it exceedingly easy to study or quickly find the regulation you're looking for. 

## Parts

## Reporting issues

Notice any problems with formatting? Broken links/images? Please create a GitHub issue and I'll take a look.

Side note, I have no idea how legal this is. I personally think it's an amazing resource that should be free but if it isn't, government people are free to contact me at `hi@kognise.dev`.
