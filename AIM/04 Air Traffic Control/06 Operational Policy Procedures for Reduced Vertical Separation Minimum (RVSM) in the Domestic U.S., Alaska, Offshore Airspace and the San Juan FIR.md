<div>

**Applicability and RVSM Mandate (Date/Time and Area) ^4-6-1**

1.  **Applicability.** The policies, guidance and direction in this section apply to RVSM operations in the airspace over the lower 48 states, Alaska, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico High Offshore Airspace and airspace in the San Juan FIR where VHF or UHF voice direct controller-pilot communication (DCPC) is normally available. Policies, guidance and direction for RVSM operations in oceanic airspace where VHF or UHF voice DCPC is not available and the airspace of other countries can be found in the Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP), Part II- En Route, ENR 1. General Rules and Procedures, and ENR 7.Oceanic Operations.
2.  **Requirement.** The FAA implemented RVSM between flight level (FL) 290-410 (inclusive) in the following airspace: the airspace of the lower 48 states of the United States, Alaska, Atlantic and Gulf of Mexico High Offshore Airspace and the San Juan FIR. RVSM has been implemented worldwide and may be applied in all ICAO Flight Information Regions (FIR).
3.  **RVSM Authorization.** In accordance with 14 CFR Section 91.180, with only limited exceptions, prior to operating in RVSM airspace, operators must comply with the standards of Part 91, Appendix G, and be authorized by the Administrator. If either the operator or the operator's aircraft have not met the applicable RVSM standards, the aircraft will be referred to as a “non-RVSM” aircraft. Paragraph 4-6-10 discusses ATC policies for accommodation of non-RVSM aircraft flown by the Department of Defense, Air Ambulance (MEDEVAC) operators, foreign State governments and aircraft flown for certification and development. Paragraph 4-6-11,  Non-RVSM Aircraft Requesting Climb to and Descent from Flight Levels Above RVSM Airspace Without Intermediate Level Off, contains policies for non-RVSM aircraft climbing and descending through RVSM airspace to/from flight levels above RVSM airspace.
4.  **Benefits.** RVSM enhances ATC flexibility, mitigates conflict points, enhances sector throughput, reduces controller workload and enables crossing traffic. Operators gain fuel savings and operating efficiency benefits by flying at more fuel efficient flight levels and on more user preferred routings.

**Flight Level Orientation Scheme ^4-6-2** Altitude assignments for direction of flight follow a scheme of odd altitude assignment for magnetic courses 000-179 degrees and even altitudes for magnetic courses 180-359 degrees for flights up to and including FL 410, as indicated in [FIG 4-6-1]{.linked-text}. <em>

**Aircraft and Operator Approval Policy/Procedures, RVSM Monitoring and Databases for Aircraft and Operator Approval ^4-6-3**

1.  **RVSM Authority**. [[Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules.md#§91.180   Operations within airspace designated as Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum airspace.|14 CFR Section 91.180]] applies to RVSM operations within the U.S. 14 CFR Section 91.706 applies to RVSM operations outside the U.S. Both sections require that the operator be authorized prior to operating in RVSM airspace. For Domestic RVSM operations, an operator may choose to operate under the provisions of Part 91, Appendix G, Section 9; or if intending to operate outside U.S. airspace, hold a specific approval (OpSpec/MSpec/LOA) under the provisions of Section 3 of Part 91, Appendix G.
2.  **Sources of Information.** Advisory Circular (AC) 91-85, Authorization of Aircraft and Operators for Flight in Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum (RVSM) Airspace, and the FAA RVSM website.
3.  **TCAS Equipage.** TCAS equipage requirements are contained in 14 CFR Sections 121.356, 125.224, 129.18 and 135.189. Part 91, Appendix G, does not contain TCAS equipage requirements specific to RVSM, however, Appendix G does require that aircraft equipped with TCAS II and flown in RVSM airspace be modified to incorporate TCAS II Version 7.0 or a later version.
4.  **Aircraft Monitoring.** Operators are required to participate in the RVSM altitude-keeping performance monitoring program that is appropriate for the type of operation being conducted. The monitoring programs are described in AC 91-85. Monitoring is a quality control program that enables the FAA and other civil aviation authorities to assess the in-service altitude-keeping performance of aircraft and operators.
5.  **Purpose of RVSM Approvals Databases.** All RVSM designated airspace is monitored airspace. ATC does not use RVSM approvals databases to determine whether or not a clearance can be issued into RVSM airspace. RVSM program managers do regularly review the operators and aircraft that operate in RVSM airspace to identify and investigate those aircraft and operators flying in RVSM airspace, but not listed on the RVSM approvals databases.
6.  **Registration of U.S. Operators.** When U.S. operators and aircraft are granted specific RVSM authority, the Separation Standards Group at the FAA Technical Center obtains PTRS operator and aircraft information to update the FAA maintained U.S. Operator/Aircraft RVSM Approvals database. Basic database operator and aircraft information can be viewed on the RVSM Documentation web page in the “RVSM Approvals” section.

**Flight Planning into RVSM Airspace ^4-6-4**

1.  Operators that do not file the correct aircraft equipment suffix on the FAA or ICAO Flight Plan may be denied clearance into RVSM airspace. Policies for the FAA Flight Plan are detailed in subparagraph c below. Policies for the ICAO Flight Plan are detailed in subparagraph d.
2.  The operator will annotate the equipment block of the FAA or ICAO Flight Plan with an aircraft equipment suffix indicating RVSM capability only after determining that both the operator is authorized and its aircraft are RVSM-compliant.
    1.  An operator may operate in RVSM airspace under the provisions of Part 91, Appendix G, Section 9, without specific authorization and should file “/w” in accordance with paragraph d.
    2.  An operator must get an OpSpec/MSpec/LOA when intending to operate RVSM outside U.S. airspace. Once issued, that operator can file “/w” in accordance with paragraph d.
    3.  An operator should not file “/w” when intending to operate in RVSM airspace outside of the U.S., if they do not hold a valid OpSpec/MSpec/LOA.
3.  General Policies for FAA Flight Plan Equipment Suffix. TBL 5-1-3, Aircraft Suffixes, allows operators to indicate that the aircraft has both RVSM and Advanced Area Navigation (RNAV) capabilities or has only RVSM capability.
    1.  The operator will annotate the equipment block of the FAA Flight Plan with the appropriate aircraft equipment suffix from TBL 5-1-3.
    2.  Operators can only file one equipment suffix in block 3 of the FAA Flight Plan. Only this equipment suffix is displayed directly to the controller.
    3.  Aircraft with RNAV Capability. For flight in RVSM airspace, aircraft with RNAV capability, but not Advanced RNAV capability, will file “/W”. Filing “/W” will not preclude such aircraft from filing and flying direct routes in en route airspace.
4.  Policy for ICAO Flight Plan Equipment Suffixes.
    1.  Operators/aircraft that are RVSM-compliant and that file ICAO flight plans will file “/W” in block 10 (Equipment) to indicate RVSM authorization and will also file the appropriate ICAO Flight Plan suffixes to indicate navigation and communication capabilities. The equipment suffixes in TBL 5-1-3 are for use only in an FAA Flight Plan (FAA Form 7233-1).
    2.  Operators/aircraft that file ICAO flight plans that include flight in Domestic U.S. RVSM airspace must file “/W” in block 10 to indicate RVSM authorization.
5.  Importance of Flight Plan Equipment Suffixes. The operator must file the appropriate equipment suffix in the equipment block of the FAA Flight Plan (FAA Form 7233-1) or the ICAO Flight Plan. The equipment suffix informs ATC:
    1.  Whether or not the operator and aircraft are authorized to fly in RVSM airspace.
    2.  The navigation and/or transponder capability of the aircraft (e.g., advanced RNAV, transponder with Mode C).
6.  Significant ATC uses of the flight plan equipment suffix information are:
    1.  To issue or deny clearance into RVSM airspace.
    2.  To apply a 2,000 foot vertical separation minimum in RVSM airspace to aircraft that are not authorized for RVSM, but are in one of the limited categories that the FAA has agreed to accommodate. (See Paragraphs 4-6-10, Procedures for Accommodation of Non-RVSM Aircraft, and 4-6-11, Non-RVSM Aircraft Requesting Climb to and Descent from Flight Levels Above RVSM Airspace Without Intermediate Level Off, for policy on limited operation of unapproved aircraft in RVSM airspace).
    3.  To determine if the aircraft has “Advanced RNAV” capabilities and can be cleared to fly procedures for which that capability is required.
7.  Improperly changing an aircraft equipment suffix and/or adding “NON-RVSM” in the NOTES or REMARKS section (Field 18) while not removing the “W” from Field 10, will not provide air traffic control with the proper visual indicator necessary to detect Non-RVSM aircraft. To ensure information processes correctly for Non-RVSM aircraft, the “W” in Field 10 must be removed. Entry of information in the NOTES or REMARKS section (Field 18) will not affect the determination of RVSM capability and must not be used to indicate a flight is Non-RVSM.

**Pilot RVSM Operating Practices and Procedures ^4-6-5**

1.  **RVSM Mandate.** If either the operator is not authorized for RVSM operations or the aircraft is not RVSM-compliant, the pilot will neither request nor accept a clearance into RVSM airspace unless:
    1.  The flight is conducted by a non-RVSM DOD, MEDEVAC, certification/development or foreign State (government) aircraft in accordance with Paragraph 4-6-10, Procedures for Accommodation of Non-RVSM Aircraft.
    2.  The pilot intends to climb to or descend from FL 430 or above in accordance with Paragraph 4-6-11, Non-RVSM Aircraft Requesting Climb to and Descent from Flight Levels Above RVSM Airspace Without Intermediate Level Off.
    3.  An emergency situation exists.
2.  **Basic RVSM Operating Practices and Procedures.** AC 91-85 contains pilot practices and procedures for RVSM. Operators must incorporate applicable practices and procedures, as supplemented by the applicable paragraphs of this section, into operator training or pilot knowledge programs and operator documents containing RVSM operational policies.
3.  AC 91-85 contains practices and procedures for flight planning, preflight procedures at the aircraft, procedures prior to RVSM airspace entry, inflight (en route) procedures, contingency procedures and post flight.
4.  The following paragraphs either clarify or supplement AC 91-85 practices and procedures.

**Guidance on Severe Turbulence and Mountain Wave Activity (MWA) ^4-6-6**

1.  **Introduction/Explanation**
    1.  The information and practices in this paragraph are provided to emphasize to pilots and controllers the importance of taking appropriate action in RVSM airspace when aircraft experience severe turbulence and/or MWA that is of sufficient magnitude to significantly affect altitude-keeping.
    2.  **Severe Turbulence.** Severe turbulence causes large, abrupt changes in altitude and/or attitude usually accompanied by large variations in indicated airspeed. Aircraft may be momentarily out of control. Encounters with severe turbulence must be remedied immediately in any phase of flight. Severe turbulence may be associated with MWA.
    3.  **Mountain Wave Activity (MWA)**
        1.  Significant MWA occurs both below and above the floor of RVSM airspace, FL 290. MWA often occurs in western states in the vicinity of mountain ranges. It may occur when strong winds blow perpendicular to mountain ranges resulting in up and down or wave motions in the atmosphere. Wave action can produce altitude excursions and airspeed fluctuations accompanied by only light turbulence. With sufficient amplitude, however, wave action can induce altitude and airspeed fluctuations accompanied by severe turbulence. MWA is difficult to forecast and can be highly localized and short lived.
        2.  Wave activity is not necessarily limited to the vicinity of mountain ranges. Pilots experiencing wave activity anywhere that significantly affects altitude-keeping can follow the guidance provided below.
        3.  Inflight MWA Indicators (Including Turbulence). Indicators that the aircraft is being subjected to MWA are:
            1.  Altitude excursions and/or airspeed fluctuations with or without associated turbulence.
            2.  Pitch and trim changes required to maintain altitude with accompanying airspeed fluctuations.
            3.  Light to severe turbulence depending on the magnitude of the MWA.
    4.  **Priority for Controller Application of Merging Target Procedures**
        1.  **Explanation of Merging Target Procedures.** As described in subparagraph c3 below, ATC will use “merging target procedures” to mitigate the effects of both severe turbulence and MWA. The procedures in subparagraph c3 have been adapted from existing procedures published in FAA Order JO 7110.65, Air Traffic Control, Paragraph 5-1-8, Merging Target Procedures. Paragraph 5-1-8 calls for en route controllers to advise pilots of potential traffic that they perceive may fly directly above or below his/her aircraft at minimum vertical separation. In response, pilots are given the option of requesting a radar vector to ensure their radar target will not merge or overlap with the traffic's radar target.
        2.  The provision of “merging target procedures” to mitigate the effects of severe turbulence and/or MWA is not optional for the controller, but rather is a priority responsibility. Pilot requests for vectors for traffic avoidance when encountering MWA or pilot reports of “Unable RVSM due turbulence or MWA” are considered first priority aircraft separation and sequencing responsibilities. (FAA Order JO 7110.65, Paragraph 2-1-2, Duty Priority, states that the controller's first priority is to separate aircraft and issue safety alerts).
        3.  Explanation of the term “traffic permitting.” The contingency actions for MWA and severe turbulence detailed [[#^4-6-9|in Paragraph 4-6-9]], Contingency Actions: Weather Encounters and Aircraft System Failures that Occur After Entry into RVSM Airspace, state that the controller will “vector aircraft to avoid merging targets with traffic at adjacent flight levels, traffic permitting.” The term “traffic permitting” is not intended to imply that merging target procedures are not a priority duty. The term is intended to recognize that, as stated in FAA Order JO 7110.65, Paragraph 2-1-2, Duty Priority, there are circumstances when the controller is required to perform more than one action and must “exercise their best judgment based on the facts and circumstances known to them” to prioritize their actions. Further direction given is: “That action which is most critical from a safety standpoint is performed first.”
    5.  **TCAS Sensitivity.** For both MWA and severe turbulence encounters in RVSM airspace, an additional concern is the sensitivity of collision avoidance systems when one or both aircraft operating in close proximity receive TCAS advisories in response to disruptions in altitude hold capability.
2.  **Pre-flight tools.** Sources of observed and forecast information that can help the pilot ascertain the possibility of MWA or severe turbulence are: Forecast Winds and Temperatures Aloft (FD), Area Forecast (FA), Graphical Turbulence Guidance (GTG), SIGMETs and PIREPs.
3.  **Pilot Actions When Encountering Weather (e.g., Severe Turbulence or MWA)**
    1.  **Weather Encounters Inducing Altitude Deviations of Approximately 200 feet.** When the pilot experiences weather induced altitude deviations of approximately 200 feet, the pilot will contact ATC and state “Unable RVSM Due (state reason)” (e.g., turbulence, mountain wave). See contingency actions [[#^4-6-9|in paragraph 4-6-9]].
    2.  **Severe Turbulence (including that associated with MWA).** When pilots encounter severe turbulence, they should contact ATC and report the situation. Until the pilot reports clear of severe turbulence, the controller will apply merging target vectors to one or both passing aircraft to prevent their targets from merging:
        <div>

        <em>**EXAMPLE-**</em>

        <em>“Yankee 123, FL 310, unable RVSM due severe turbulence.”</em>

        <em>“Yankee 123, fly heading 290; traffic twelve o'clock, 10 miles, opposite direction; eastbound MD-80 at FL 320” (or the controller may issue a vector to the MD-80 traffic to avoid Yankee 123).</em>

        </div>
    3.  **MWA.** When pilots encounter MWA, they should contact ATC and report the magnitude and location of the wave activity. When a controller makes a merging targets traffic call, the pilot may request a vector to avoid flying directly over or under the traffic. In situations where the pilot is experiencing altitude deviations of 200 feet or greater, the pilot will request a vector to avoid traffic. Until the pilot reports clear of MWA, the controller will apply merging target vectors to one or both passing aircraft to prevent their targets from merging:
        <div>

        <em>**EXAMPLE-**</em>

        <em>“Yankee 123, FL 310, unable RVSM due mountain wave.”</em>

        <em>“Yankee 123, fly heading 290; traffic twelve o'clock, 10 miles, opposite direction; eastbound MD-80 at FL 320” (or the controller may issue a vector to the MD-80 traffic to avoid Yankee 123).</em>

        </div>
    4.  **FL Change or Re-route.** To leave airspace where MWA or severe turbulence is being encountered, the pilot may request a FL change and/or re-route, if necessary.

**Guidance on Wake Turbulence ^4-6-7**

1.  Pilots should be aware of the potential for wake turbulence encounters in RVSM airspace. Experience gained since 1997 has shown that such encounters in RVSM airspace are generally moderate or less in magnitude.
2.  Prior to DRVSM implementation, the FAA established provisions for pilots to report wake turbulence events in RVSM airspace using the NASA Aviation Safety Reporting System (ASRS). A “Safety Reporting” section established on the FAA RVSM Documentation web page provides contacts, forms, and reporting procedures.
3.  To date, wake turbulence has not been reported as a significant factor in DRVSM operations. European authorities also found that reports of wake turbulence encounters did not increase significantly after RVSM implementation (eight versus seven reports in a ten-month period). In addition, they found that reported wake turbulence was generally similar to moderate clear air turbulence.
4.  Pilot Action to Mitigate Wake Turbulence Encounters
    1.  Pilots should be alert for wake turbulence when operating:
        1.  In the vicinity of aircraft climbing or descending through their altitude.
        2.  Approximately 10-30 miles after passing 1,000 feet below opposite-direction traffic.
        3.  Approximately 10-30 miles behind and 1,000 feet below same-direction traffic.
    2.  Pilots encountering or anticipating wake turbulence in DRVSM airspace have the option of requesting a vector, FL change, or if capable, a lateral offset.
        <div>

        <em>**NOTE-**</em>

        1.  <em>Offsets of approximately a wing span upwind generally can move the aircraft out of the immediate vicinity of another aircraft's wake vortex.</em>
        2.  <em>In domestic U.S. airspace, pilots must request clearance to fly a lateral offset. Strategic lateral offsets flown in oceanic airspace do not apply.</em>

**Procedures for Accommodation of Non-RVSM Aircraft ^4-6-10**

1.  **General Policies for Accommodation of Non-RVSM Aircraft**
    1.  The RVSM mandate calls for only RVSM authorized aircraft/operators to fly in designated RVSM airspace with limited exceptions. The policies detailed below are intended exclusively for use by aircraft that the FAA has agreed to accommodate. They are not intended to provide other operators a means to circumvent the normal RVSM approval process.
    2.  If the operator is not authorized or the aircraft is not RVSM-compliant, the aircraft will be referred to as a “non-RVSM” aircraft. [[Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules.md#§91.180   Operations within airspace designated as Reduced Vertical Separation Minimum airspace.|14 CFR Section 91.180]] and Part 91, Appendix G, enable the FAA to authorize a deviation to operate a non-RVSM aircraft in RVSM airspace.
    3.  Non-RVSM aircraft flights will be handled on a workload permitting basis. The vertical separation standard applied between aircraft not approved for RVSM and all other aircraft must be 2,000 feet.
    4.  **Required Pilot Calls.** The pilot of non-RVSM aircraft will inform the controller of the lack of RVSM approval in accordance with the direction provided [[#^4-6-8|in Paragraph 4-6-8]], Pilot/Controller Phraseology.
2.  **Categories of Non-RVSM Aircraft that may be Accommodated**  
    Subject to FAA approval and clearance, the following categories of non-RVSM aircraft may operate in domestic U.S. RVSM airspace provided they have an operational transponder.
    1.  Department of Defense (DOD) aircraft.
    2.  Flights conducted for aircraft certification and development purposes.
    3.  Active air ambulance flights utilizing a “MEDEVAC” call sign.
    4.  Aircraft climbing/descending through RVSM flight levels (without intermediate level off) to/from FLs above RVSM airspace (Policies for these flights are detailed [[#^4-6-11|in Paragraph 4-6-11]], Non-RVSM Aircraft Requesting Climb to and Descent from Flight Levels Above RVSM Airspace Without Intermediate Level Off.
    5.  Foreign State (government) aircraft.
3.  Methods for operators of non-RVSM aircraft to request access to RVSM Airspace. Operators may:
    1.  **LOA/MOU.** Enter into a Letter of Agreement (LOA)/Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the RVSM facility (the Air Traffic facility that provides air traffic services in RVSM airspace). Operators must comply with LOA/MOU.
    2.  **File-and-Fly.** File a flight plan to notify the FAA of their intention to request access to RVSM airspace.
        <div>

        <em>**NOTE-**</em>

        <em>Priority for access to RVSM airspace will be afforded to RVSM compliant aircraft, then File-and-Fly flights.</em>

        </div>

**Non-RVSM Aircraft Requesting Climb to and Descent from Flight Levels Above RVSM Airspace Without Intermediate Level Off ^4-6-11**

1.  **File-and-Fly.** Operators of Non-RVSM aircraft climbing to and descending from RVSM flight levels should just file a flight plan.
2.  Non-RVSM aircraft climbing to and descending from flight levels above RVSM airspace will be handled on a workload permitting basis. The vertical separation standard applied in RVSM airspace between non-RVSM aircraft and all other aircraft must be 2,000 feet.
3.  Non-RVSM aircraft climbing to/descending from RVSM airspace can only be considered for accommodation provided:
    1.  Aircraft is capable of a continuous climb/descent and does not need to level off at an intermediate altitude for any operational considerations and
    2.  Aircraft is capable of climb/descent at the normal rate for the aircraft.
4.  **Required Pilot Calls.** The pilot of non-RVSM aircraft will inform the controller of the lack of RVSM approval in accordance with the direction provided [[#^4-6-8|in Paragraph 4-6-8]], Pilot/Controller Phraseology.
