<div>

**Preflight Preparation ^5-1-1**

1.  Every pilot is urged to receive a preflight briefing and to file a flight plan. This briefing should consist of the latest or most current weather, airport, and en route NAVAID information. Briefing service may be obtained from an FSS either by telephone or radio when airborne. Pilots within the contiguous U.S. may access Flight Service through [**www.1800wxbrief.com**](http://www.1800wxbrief.com/) or by contacting them at 1-800-WX-Brief to obtain preflight weather data and to file IFR and VFR flight plans.
    <div>

    <em>**NOTE-**</em>

    <em>Pilots filing flight plans via “fast file” who desire to have their briefing recorded, should include a statement at the end of the recording as to the source of their weather briefing.</em>

    </div>
2.  The information required by the FAA to process flight plans is contained on FAA Form 7233-1, Flight Plan, or FAA Form 7233-4, International Flight Plan. The forms are available at all flight service stations. Additional copies will be provided on request.
    <div>

    </div>
3.  Consult an FSS for preflight weather briefing.
4.  FSSs are required to advise of pertinent NOTAMs if a <em>standard</em> briefing is requested, but if they are overlooked, do not hesitate to remind the specialist that you have not received NOTAM information.
    <div>

    <em>**NOTE-**</em>

    <em>Domestic Notices and International Notices are not provided during a briefing unless specifically requested by the pilot since the FSS specialist has no way of knowing whether the pilot has already checked the Federal NOTAM System (FNS) NOTAM Search System External links prior to calling. Airway NOTAMs, procedural NOTAMs, and NOTAMs that are general in nature and not tied to a specific airport/facility (for example, flight advisories and restrictions, open duration special security instructions, and special flight rules areas) are briefed solely by pilot request. Remember to ask for these Notices if you have not already reviewed this information, and to request all pertinent NOTAMs specific to your flight.</em>

    </div>
5.  Pilots are urged to use only the latest issue of aeronautical charts in planning and conducting flight operations. Aeronautical charts are revised and reissued on a regular scheduled basis to ensure that depicted data are current and reliable. In the conterminous U.S., Sectional Charts are updated every 6 months, IFR En Route Charts every 56 days, and amendments to civil IFR Approach Charts are accomplished on a 56-day cycle with a change notice volume issued on the 28-day midcycle. Charts that have been superseded by those of a more recent date may contain obsolete or incomplete flight information.
    <div>

    <em> [[09 Aeronautical Charts and Related Publications/01 Types of Charts Available#^9-1-4|AIM, Paragraph 9-1-4]], General Description of Each Chart Series </em>

    </div>
6.  When requesting a preflight briefing, identify yourself as a pilot and provide the following:
    1.  Type of flight planned; e.g., VFR or IFR.
    2.  Aircraft's number or pilot's name.
    3.  Aircraft type.
    4.  Departure Airport.
    5.  Route of flight.
    6.  Destination.
    7.  Flight altitude(s).
    8.  ETD and ETE.
7.  Prior to conducting a briefing, briefers are required to have the background information listed above so that they may tailor the briefing to the needs of the proposed flight. The objective is to communicate a “picture” of meteorological and aeronautical information necessary for the conduct of a safe and efficient flight. Briefers use all available weather and aeronautical information to summarize data applicable to the proposed flight. They do not read weather reports and forecasts verbatim unless specifically requested by the pilot. FSS briefers do not provide FDC NOTAM information for special instrument approach procedures unless specifically asked. Pilots authorized by the FAA to use special instrument approach procedures must specifically request FDC NOTAM information for these procedures. Pilots who receive the information electronically will receive NOTAMs for special IAPs automatically.

8.  FAA by [[Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0093 Special air traffic rules.md|14 CFR Part 93]], Subpart K, has designated High Density Traffic Airports (HDTA) and has prescribed air traffic rules and requirements for operating aircraft (excluding helicopter operations) to and from these airports.

    </div>
9.  In addition to the filing of a flight plan, if the flight will traverse or land in one or more foreign countries, it is particularly important that pilots leave a complete itinerary with someone directly concerned and keep that person advised of the flight's progress. If serious doubt arises as to the safety of the flight, that person should first contact the FSS.

**Follow IFR Procedures Even When Operating VFR ^5-1-2**

1.  To maintain IFR proficiency, pilots are urged to practice IFR procedures whenever possible, even when operating VFR. Some suggested practices include:
    1.  Obtain a complete preflight and weather briefing. Check the NOTAMs.
    2.  File a flight plan. This is an excellent low cost insurance policy. The cost is the time it takes to fill it out. The insurance includes the knowledge that someone will be looking for you if you become overdue at your destination.
    3.  Use current charts.
    4.  Use the navigation aids. Practice maintaining a good course-keep the needle centered.
    5.  Maintain a constant altitude which is appropriate for the direction of flight.
    6.  Estimate en route position times.
    7.  Make accurate and frequent position reports to the FSSs along your route of flight.
2.  Simulated IFR flight is recommended (under the hood); however, pilots are cautioned to review and adhere to the requirements specified in 14 CFR Section 91.109 before and during such flight.
3.  When flying VFR at night, in addition to the altitude appropriate for the direction of flight, pilots should maintain an altitude which is at or above the minimum en route altitude as shown on charts. This is especially true in mountainous terrain, where there is usually very little ground reference. Do not depend on your eyes alone to avoid rising unlighted terrain, or even lighted obstructions such as TV towers.

**Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) System ^5-1-3**

1.  Time-critical aeronautical information that is of either a temporary nature or not sufficiently known in advance to permit publication on aeronautical charts or in other operational publications, receives immediate dissemination via the NOTAM System. When data appearing in a NOTAM is printed correctly in a publication or on a chart, or when a temporary condition is returned to normal status, the corresponding NOTAM is canceled. NOTAMs are eligible to be disseminated up to 7 days before the start of activity. Pilots can access NOTAM information via FSS or online via NOTAM Search at: [**https://notams.aim.faa.gov/notamSearch/**](https://notams.aim.faa.gov/notamSearch/).
2.  In accordance with 14 CFR § 91.103, Preflight Action, prior to departure, pilots must become familiar with a[[Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules.md#§91.103   Preflight action.|14 CFR § 91.103]]formation concerning that flight, including NOTAMs. NOTAM information is aeronautical information that could affect a pilot's decision to make a flight and includes changes to:
    1.  Aerodromes.
    2.  Runways, taxiways, and ramp restrictions.
    3.  Obstructions.
    4.  Communications.
    5.  Airspace.
    6.  Status of navigational aids, ILSs, or radar service availability.
    7.  Other information essential to planned en route, terminal, or landing operations.
3.  Pilots should ensure they review those NOTAMs contained under the ARTCC location (for example, ZDC, ZOB, etc.) that the flight is operating within as they can include NOTAMs relevant to all operations, including Central Altitude Reservation Function (CARF), Special Use Airspace (SUA), Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR), Global Positioning System (GPS), Flight Data Center (FDC) changes to routes, wind turbine, and Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS).
    <div>

    <em>**NOTE-**</em>

    <em>NOTAM information is transmitted using ICAO contractions to reduce transmission time. See TBL 5-1-2 for a listing of the most commonly used contractions, or go online to the following URL: [**https://www.notams.faa.gov/downloads/contractions.pdf**](https://www.notams.faa.gov/downloads/contractions.pdf). For a complete listing of approved NOTAM Contractions, see FAA JO Order 7340.2, Contractions.</em>

    </div>
4.  Due to the changeable nature of the NAS components, and frequent processing of NOTAM information, it is recommended, that while en route, pilots contact ATC or FSS and obtain updated information for their route of flight and destination. Pilots should be particularly vigilant when operating at locations without an operating control tower. Dynamic situations, such as snow removal, fire and rescue activities, construction, and wildlife encroachment, may pose hazards that may not reach the pilot prior to arrival/departure.
5.  If a NAVAID fails or is removed from service prior to all airspace and procedural dependencies being removed, a NOTAM is published to inform pilots of the NAVAID being Unserviceable (U/S). Pilots must check NOTAMs to ensure any NAVAID required for the flight is in service. There can be considerable time between the NAVAID being U/S and ultimately its removal from the charts, which, during the transition period, means a NOTAM is the primary method of alerting pilots to its unavailability. It is recommended that pilots using VFR charts should regularly consult the Aeronautical Chart Bulletin found in the back matter of the appropriate Chart Supplement U.S. This bulletin identifies any updates to the chart that have not yet been accounted for because of the extended six-month chart cycle for most VFR charts.
    <div>

    <em>**NOTE-**</em>

    1.  <em>Pilots should be alert for NAVAIDs having a dissimilar identifier from the airport(s) they serve and to use the Chart Supplement U.S. to identify the correct NAVAID NOTAM file. Flight planning should include review of NAVAIDs that aren't included for the departure/destination airport but may be part of the route of flight.</em>
    2.  <em>Charts may indicate a NAVAID's unavailability by depicting a crosshatch pattern through the frequency, which indicates its shutdown status.</em>

    </div>
6.  NOTAM information is classified as Domestic NOTAMs (NOTAM D), Flight Data Center (FDC) NOTAMs, International NOTAMs, or Military NOTAMs.
    1.  **NOTAM (D)** information is disseminated for all navigational facilities that are part of the National Airspace System (NAS), all public use aerodromes, seaplane bases, and heliports listed in the Chart Supplement U.S. NOTAM (D) information includes such data as taxiway closures, personnel and equipment near or crossing runways, and airport lighting aids that do not affect instrument approach criteria, such as VASI. All NOTAM Ds must have one of the keywords listed in TBL 5-1-1, as the first part of the text after the location identifier. These keywords categorize NOTAM Ds by subject; for example, APRON (ramp), RWY (runway), SVC (Services), etc. There are several types of NOTAM Ds:
        1.  Aerodrome activity and conditions, to include field conditions.
        2.  Airspace to include CARF, SUA, and general airspace activity like UAS or pyrotechnics.
        3.  Visual and radio navigational aids.
        4.  Communication and services.
        5.  Pointer NOTAMs. NOTAMs issued to point to additional aeronautical information. When pointing to another NOTAM, the keyword in the pointer NOTAM must match the keyword in the original NOTAM. Pointer NOTAMs should be issued for, but are not limited to, TFRs, Airshows, Temporary SUA, major NAS system interruptions, etc.
    2.  **FDC NOTAMs.** On those occasions when it becomes necessary to disseminate information that is regulatory in nature, an FDC NOTAM is issued. FDC NOTAMs include NOTAMs such as:
        1.  Amendments to published IAPs and other current aeronautical charts.
        2.  Temporary Flight Restrictions (TFR). Pilots should read NOTAMs in their entirety as some TFRs may allow pilots to fly through the flight restriction should they request permission to do so and subsequently receive it. Pilots are encouraged to use online preflight resources as they provide graphics and plain language interpretations for TFRs.
        3.  High barometric pressure warning.
        4.  Laser light activity.
        5.  ADS-B, TIS-B, and FIS-B service availability.
        6.  Satellite-based systems such as WAAS or GPS.
        7.  Special Notices.
    3.  **International NOTAMs.**
        1.  Distributed to more than one country, they are published in ICAO format under guidelines established in Annex 15. International NOTAMs issued by the U.S. NOTAM Office use Series A followed by 4 sequential numbers, a slant “/” and a 2-digit number representing the year the NOTAM was issued. For the most part, International NOTAMs duplicate data found in a U.S. Domestic NOTAM.
        2.  Not every topic of a U.S. Domestic NOTAM is issued as an International NOTAM by the U.S. When possible, the U.S. International NOTAM will be linked to the appropriate U.S. Domestic NOTAM.
        3.  International NOTAMs received by the FAA from other countries are stored in the U.S. NOTAM System.
        4.  The International NOTAM format includes a “Q” Line that can be easily read/parsed by a computer and allows the NOTAM to be displayed digitally.
            1.  Field A:  ICAO location identifier or FIR affected by the NOTAM.
            2.  Field B: Start of Validity.
            3.  Field C: End of Validity (both in \[Year\]\[Month\]\[Day\]\[Hour\]\[Minute\] format).
            4.  Field D: (when present) Schedule.
            5.  Field E: Full NOTAM description.
            6.  Field F: (when present) Lowest altitude, or “SFC.”
            7.  Field G: (when present) Highest altitude, or “UNL.”
        5.  For more on International format, please see Annex 15.
    4.  **Military NOTAMs.** NOTAMs originated by the U.S. Air Force, Army, Marine, or Navy, and pertaining to military or joint-use navigational aids/airports that are part of the NAS. Military NOTAMs are published in the International NOTAM format and should be reviewed by users of a military or joint-use facility.
7.  Security NOTAMS:
    1.  U.S. Domestic Security NOTAMS are FDC NOTAMS that inform pilots of certain U.S. security activities or requirements, such as Special Security Instructions for aircraft operations to, from, within, or transitioning U.S. territorial airspace. These NOTAMS are found on the Federal NOTAM System (FNS) NOTAM Search website under the location designator KZZZ.
    2.  United States International Flight Prohibitions, Potential Hostile Situations, and Foreign Notices are issued by the FAA and are found on the Federal NOTAM System (FNS) NOTAM Search website under the location designator KICZ. <em>

**Flight Plan - VFR Flights ^5-1-4**

1.  Except for operations in or penetrating an ADIZ, a flight plan is not required for VFR flight.
    <div>

    <em>**REFERENCE-**</em>

    <em> AIM, Chapter 5, Section 6, National Security and Interception Procedures </em>

    </div>
2.  It is strongly recommended that a flight plan (for a VFR flight) be filed with an FAA FSS. This will ensure that you receive VFR Search and Rescue Protection.
    <div>

    <em>**REFERENCE-**</em>

    <em> [[06 Emergency Procedures/02 Emergency Services Available to Pilots#^6-2-6|AIM, Paragraph 6-2-6]], Search and Rescue, gives the proper method of filing a VFR flight plan. </em>

    </div>
3.  To obtain maximum benefits from the flight plan program, flight plans should be filed directly with the nearest FSS. For your convenience, FSSs provide aeronautical and meteorological briefings while accepting flight plans. Radio may be used to file if no other means are available.
    <div>

    <em>**NOTE-**</em>

    <em>Some states operate aeronautical communications facilities which will accept and forward flight plans to the FSS for further handling.</em>

    </div>
4.  When a “stopover” flight is anticipated, it is recommended that a separate flight plan be filed for each “leg” when the stop is expected to be more than 1 hour duration.
5.  Pilots are encouraged to give their departure times directly to the FSS serving the departure airport or as otherwise indicated by the FSS when the flight plan is filed. This will ensure more efficient flight plan service and permit the FSS to advise you of significant changes in aeronautical facilities or meteorological conditions. When a VFR flight plan is filed, it will be held by the FSS until 1 hour after the proposed departure time unless:
    1.  The actual departure time is received.
    2.  A revised proposed departure time is received.
    3.  At a time of filing, the FSS is informed that the proposed departure time will be met, but actual time cannot be given because of inadequate communications (assumed departures).
6.  On pilot's request, at a location having an active tower, the aircraft identification will be forwarded by the tower to the FSS for reporting the actual departure time. This procedure should be avoided at busy airports.
7.  Although position reports are not required for VFR flight plans, periodic reports to FAA FSSs along the route are good practice. Such contacts permit significant information to be passed to the transiting aircraft and also serve to check the progress of the flight should it be necessary for any reason to locate the aircraft.
    <div>

    <em>**EXAMPLE-**</em>

    1.  <em>Bonanza 314K, over Kingfisher at (time), VFR flight plan, Tulsa to Amarillo.</em>
    2.  <em>Cherokee 5133J, over Oklahoma City at (time), Shreveport to Denver, no flight plan.</em>

    </div>
8.  Pilots not operating on an IFR flight plan and when in level cruising flight, are cautioned to conform with VFR cruising altitudes appropriate to the direction of flight.
9.  When filing VFR flight plans, indicate aircraft equipment capabilities by appending the appropriate suffix to aircraft type in the same manner as that prescribed for IFR flight.
    <div>

    <em>**REFERENCE-**</em>

    <em> [[#^5-1-8|AIM, Paragraph 5-1-8]], Flight Plan- Domestic IFR Flights </em>

    </div>
10. Under some circumstances, ATC computer tapes can be useful in constructing the radar history of a downed or crashed aircraft. In each case, knowledge of the aircraft's transponder/ADS-B equipment is necessary in determining whether or not such computer tapes might prove effective. <em>

        </div>

**Operational Information System (OIS) ^5-1-5**

1.  The FAA's Air Traffic Control System Command Center (ATCSCC) maintains a website with near real-time National Airspace System (NAS) status information. NAS operators are encouraged to access the website at **<http://www.fly.faa.gov>** prior to filing their flight plan.
2.  The website consolidates information from advisories. An advisory is a message that is disseminated electronically by the ATCSCC that contains information pertinent to the NAS.
    1.  Advisories are normally issued for the following items:
        1.  Ground Stops.
        2.  Ground Delay Programs.
        3.  Route Information.
        4.  Plan of Operations.
        5.  Facility Outages and Scheduled Facility Outages.
        6.  Volcanic Ash Activity Bulletins.
        7.  Special Traffic Management Programs.
    2.  This list is not all-inclusive. Any time there is information that may be beneficial to a large number of people, an advisory may be sent. Additionally, there may be times when an advisory is not sent due to workload or the short length of time of the activity.
    3.  Route information is available on the website and in specific advisories. Some route information, subject to the 56-day publishing cycle, is located on the “OIS” under “Products,” Route Management Tool (RMT), and “What's New” Playbook. The RMT and Playbook contain routings for use by Air Traffic and NAS operators when they are coordinated “real-time” and are then published in an ATCSCC advisory.
    4.  Route advisories are identified by the word “Route” in the header; the associated action is required (RQD), recommended (RMD), planned (PLN), or for your information (FYI). Operators are expected to file flight plans consistent with the Route RQD advisories.
    5.  Electronic System Impact Reports are on the intranet at <http://www.atcscc.faa.gov/ois/> under “System Impact Reports." This page lists scheduled outages/events/projects that significantly impact the NAS; for example, runway closures, air shows, and construction projects. Information includes anticipated delays and traffic management initiatives (TMI) that may be implemented.

**Flight Plan- Defense VFR (DVFR) Flights ^5-1-6** VFR flights (except DOD or law enforcement flights) into an ADIZ are required to file DVFR flight plans for security purposes. Detailed ADIZ procedures are found in Section 6, National Security and Interception Procedures, of this chapter. (See 14 CFR Part 99, Security Control of Air Traffic)

**Composite Flight Plan (VFR/IFR Flights) ^5-1-7**

1.  Flight plans which specify VFR operation for one portion of a flight, and IFR for another portion, will be accepted by the FSS at the point of departure. If VFR flight is conducted for the first portion of the flight, pilots should report their departure time to the FSS with whom the VFR/IFR flight plan was filed; and, subsequently, close the VFR portion and request ATC clearance from the FSS nearest the point at which change from VFR to IFR is proposed. Regardless of the type facility you are communicating with (FSS, center, or tower), it is the pilot's responsibility to request that facility to “CLOSE VFR FLIGHT PLAN.” The pilot must remain in VFR weather conditions until operating in accordance with the IFR clearance.
2.  When a flight plan indicates IFR for the first portion of flight and VFR for the latter portion, the pilot will normally be cleared to the point at which the change is proposed. After reporting over the clearance limit and not desiring further IFR clearance, the pilot should advise ATC to cancel the IFR portion of the flight plan. Then, the pilot should contact the nearest FSS to activate the VFR portion of the flight plan. If the pilot desires to continue the IFR flight plan beyond the clearance limit, the pilot should contact ATC at least 5 minutes prior to the clearance limit and request further IFR clearance. If the requested clearance is not received prior to reaching the clearance limit fix, the pilot will be expected to enter into a standard holding pattern on the radial or course to the fix unless a holding pattern for the clearance limit fix is depicted on a U.S. Government or commercially produced (meeting FAA requirements) low or high altitude enroute, area or STAR chart. In this case the pilot will hold according to the depicted pattern.

**Flight Plan (FAA Form 7233-1)- Domestic IFR Flights ^5-1-8**

<div>

<em>**NOTE-**</em>

1.  <em>Procedures outlined in this section apply to operators filing FAA Form 7233-1 (Flight Plan) and to flights that will be conducted entirely within U.S. domestic airspace.</em>
2.  <em>Filers utilizing FAA Form 7233-1 may not be eligible for assignment of RNAV SIDs and STARs. Filers desiring assignment of these procedures should file using FAA Form 7233-4 (International Flight Plan), as described [[#^5-1-9|in paragraph 5-1-9]].</em>

</div>

1.  **General**
    1.  Prior to departure from within, or prior to entering controlled airspace, a pilot must submit a complete flight plan and receive an air traffic clearance, if weather conditions are below VFR minimums. Instrument flight plans may be submitted to the nearest FSS or ATCT either in person or by telephone (or by radio if no other means are available). Pilots should file IFR flight plans at least 30 minutes prior to estimated time of departure to preclude possible delay in receiving a departure clearance from ATC. In order to provide FAA traffic management units strategic route planning capabilities, nonscheduled operators conducting IFR operations above FL 230 are requested to voluntarily file IFR flight plans at least 4 hours prior to estimated time of departure (ETD). To minimize your delay in entering Class B, Class C, Class D, and Class E surface areas at destination when IFR weather conditions exist or are forecast at that airport, an IFR flight plan should be filed before departure. Otherwise, a 30 minute delay is not unusual in receiving an ATC clearance because of time spent in processing flight plan data. Traffic saturation frequently prevents control personnel from accepting flight plans by radio. In such cases, the pilot is advised to contact the nearest FSS for the purpose of filing the flight plan.
        <div>

        <em>**NOTE-**</em>

        1.  <em>There are several methods of obtaining IFR clearances at nontower, non-FSS, and outlying airports. The procedure may vary due to geographical features, weather conditions, and the complexity of the ATC system. To determine the most effective means of receiving an IFR clearance, pilots should ask the nearest FSS the most appropriate means of obtaining the IFR clearance.</em>
        2.  <em>When requesting an IFR clearance, it is highly recommended that the departure airport be identified by stating the city name and state and/or the airport location identifier in order to clarify to ATC the exact location of the intended airport of departure.</em>

        </div>
    2.  When filing an IFR flight plan, include as a prefix to the aircraft type, the number of aircraft when more than one and/or heavy aircraft indicator “H/” if appropriate.
        <div>

        <em>**EXAMPLE-**</em>

        <em>H/DC10/A</em><em>  
        2/F15/A</em>

        </div>
    3.  When filing an IFR flight plan, identify the equipment capability by adding a suffix, preceded by a slant, to the AIRCRAFT TYPE, as shown in TBL 5-1-3, Aircraft Suffixes.
        <div>

        <em>**NOTE-**</em>

        1.  <em>ATC issues clearances based on filed suffixes. Pilots should determine the appropriate suffix based upon desired services and/or routing. For example, if a desired route/procedure requires GPS, a pilot should file /G even if the aircraft also qualifies for other suffixes.</em>
        2.  <em>For procedures requiring GPS, if the navigation system does not automatically alert the flight crew of a loss of GPS, the operator must develop procedures to verify correct GPS operation.</em>
        3.  <em>The suffix is not to be added to the aircraft identification or be transmitted by radio as part of the aircraft identification.</em>

        </div>
    4.  It is recommended that pilots file the maximum transponder/ADS-B and navigation capability of their aircraft in the equipment suffix. This will provide ATC with the necessary information to utilize all facets of navigational equipment and transponder capabilities available.
    5.  When filing an IFR flight plan via telephone or radio, it is highly recommended that the departure airport be clearly identified by stating the city name and state and/or airport location identifier. With cell phone use and flight service specialists covering larger areas of the country, clearly identifying the departure airport can prevent confusing your airport of departure with those of identical or similar names in other states. <em>

2.  **Airways and Jet Routes Depiction on Flight Plan**
    1.  It is vitally important that the route of flight be accurately and completely described in the flight plan. To simplify definition of the proposed route, and to facilitate ATC, pilots are requested to file via airways or jet routes established for use at the altitude or flight level planned.
    2.  If flight is to be conducted via designated airways or jet routes, describe the route by indicating the type and number designators of the airway(s) or jet route(s) requested. If more than one airway or jet route is to be used, clearly indicate points of transition. If the transition is made at an unnamed intersection, show the next succeeding NAVAID or named intersection on the intended route and the complete route from that point. Reporting points may be identified by using authorized name/code as depicted on appropriate aeronautical charts. The following two examples illustrate the need to specify the transition point when two routes share more than one transition fix.
        <div>

        <em>**EXAMPLE-**</em>

        1.  <em>ALB J37 BUMPY J14 BHM  
            </em><em> Spelled out:  
            from Albany, New York, via Jet Route 37 transitioning to Jet Route 14 at BUMPY intersection, thence via Jet Route 14 to Birmingham, Alabama.  
            </em>
        2.  <em>ALB J37 ENO J14 BHM  
            </em><em> Spelled out:  
            from Albany, New York, via Jet Route 37 transitioning to Jet Route 14 at Smyrna VORTAC (ENO) thence via Jet Route 14 to Birmingham, Alabama.</em>

        </div>
    3.  The route of flight may also be described by naming the reporting points or NAVAIDs over which the flight will pass, provided the points named are established for use at the altitude or flight level planned.
        <div>

        <em>**EXAMPLE-**</em>

        <em>BWI V44 SWANN V433 DQO</em><em>  
        Spelled out: from Baltimore‐Washington International, via Victor 44 to Swann intersection, transitioning to Victor 433 at Swann, thence via Victor 433 to Dupont.</em>

        </div>
    4.  When the route of flight is defined by named reporting points, whether alone or in combination with airways or jet routes, and the navigational aids (VOR, VORTAC, TACAN, NDB) to be used for the flight are a combination of different types of aids, enough information should be included to clearly indicate the route requested.
        <div>

        <em>**EXAMPLE-**</em>

        <em>LAX J5 LKV J3 GEG YXC FL 330 J500 VLR J515 YWG</em><em>  
        Spelled out: from Los Angeles International via Jet Route 5 Lakeview, Jet Route 3 Spokane, direct Cranbrook, British Columbia VOR/DME, Flight Level 330 Jet Route 500 to Langruth, Manitoba VORTAC, Jet Route 515 to Winnepeg, Manitoba.</em>

        </div>
    5.  When filing IFR, it is to the pilot's advantage to file a preferred route.
        <div>

        <em>**REFERENCE-**</em>

        <em> Preferred IFR Routes are described and tabulated in the Chart Supplement U.S. </em>

        </div>
    6.  ATC may issue a SID or a STAR, as appropriate.
        <div>

        <em>**REFERENCE-**</em>

        <em> [[02 Departure Procedures#^5-2-9|AIM, Paragraph 5-2-9]], Instrument Departure Procedures (DP) - Obstacle Departure Procedures (ODP) and Standard Instrument Departures (SID)  
        [[04 Arrival Procedures#^5-4-1|AIM, Paragraph 5-4-1]], Standard Terminal Arrival (STAR) Procedures </em>

        </div>

        <div>

        <em>**NOTE-**</em>

        <em>Pilots not desiring a SID or STAR should so indicate in the remarks section of the flight plan as “no SID” or “no STAR.”</em>

        </div>
3.  **Direct Flights**
    1.  All or any portions of the route which will not be flown on the radials or courses of established airways or routes, such as direct route flights, must be defined by indicating the radio fixes over which the flight will pass. Fixes selected to define the route must be those over which the position of the aircraft can be accurately determined. Such fixes automatically become compulsory reporting points for the flight, unless advised otherwise by ATC. Only those navigational aids established for use in a particular structure; i.e., in the low or high structures, may be used to define the en route phase of a direct flight within that altitude structure.
    2.  The azimuth feature of VOR aids and the azimuth and distance (DME) features of VORTAC and TACAN aids are assigned certain frequency protected areas of airspace which are intended for application to established airway and route use, and to provide guidance for planning flights outside of established airways or routes. These areas of airspace are expressed in terms of cylindrical service volumes of specified dimensions called “class limits” or “categories.”
        <div>

        <em>**REFERENCE-**</em>

        <em> AIM, Para 1-1-8, NAVAID Service Volumes. </em>

        </div>
    3.  An operational service volume has been established for each class in which adequate signal coverage and frequency protection can be assured. To facilitate use of VOR, VORTAC, or TACAN aids, consistent with their operational service volume limits, pilot use of such aids for defining a direct route of flight in controlled airspace should not exceed the following:
        1.  Operations above FL 450 - Use aids not more than 200 NM apart. These aids are depicted on enroute high altitude charts.
        2.  Operation off established routes from 18,000 feet MSL to FL 450 - Use aids not more than 260 NM apart. These aids are depicted on enroute high altitude charts.
        3.  Operation off established airways below 18,000 feet MSL - Use aids not more than 80 NM apart. These aids are depicted on enroute low altitude charts.
        4.  Operation off established airways between 14,500 feet MSL and 17,999 feet MSL in the conterminous U.S. - (H) facilities not more than 200 NM apart may be used.
    4.  Increasing use of self-contained airborne navigational systems which do not rely on the VOR/VORTAC/TACAN system has resulted in pilot requests for direct routes that exceed NAVAID service volume limits. With the exception of GNSS-equipped aircraft, [t]{.ul}hese direct route requests will be approved only in a radar environment, with approval based on pilot responsibility for navigation on the authorized direct route. Radar flight following will be provided by ATC for ATC purposes. For GNSS-equipped aircraft, ATC may approve a direct route that exceeds ground based NAVAID service volume limits; however, in a non-radar environment, the routing must be “point-to-point,” defined as navigation from a published point to a published point, and navigational assistance will not be available. ([[#^5-1-8|See subparagraph 5-1-8]]d below.)
    5.  At times, ATC will initiate a direct route in a radar environment that exceeds NAVAID service volume limits. In such cases ATC will provide radar monitoring and navigational assistance as necessary. For GNSS-equipped aircraft, if the route is point-to-point, radar monitoring and navigational assistance is not required. ([[#^5-1-8|See subparagraph 5-1-8]]d below.)
    6.  Airway or jet route numbers, appropriate to the stratum in which operation will be conducted, may also be included to describe portions of the route to be flown.
        <div>

        <em>**EXAMPLE-**</em>

        <em>MDW V262 BDF V10 BRL STJ SLN GCK</em><em>  
        Spelled out: from Chicago Midway Airport via Victor 262 to Bradford, Victor 10 to Burlington, Iowa, direct St. Joseph, Missouri, direct Salina, Kansas, direct Garden City, Kansas.</em>

        </div>

        <div>

        <em>**NOTE-**</em>

        <em>When route of flight is described by radio fixes, the pilot will be expected to fly a direct course between the points named.</em>

        </div>
    7.  Pilots are reminded that they are responsible for adhering to obstruction clearance requirements on those segments of direct routes that are outside of controlled airspace. The MEAs and other altitudes shown on low altitude IFR enroute charts pertain to those route segments within controlled airspace, and those altitudes may not meet obstruction clearance criteria when operating off those routes.
4.  **Area Navigation (RNAV)/Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)**
    1.  Except for GNSS-equipped aircraft, random impromptu routes can only be approved in a radar environment. A random impromptu route is a direct course initiated by ATC or requested by the pilot during flight. Aircraft are cleared from their present position to a NAVAID, waypoint, fix, or airport. Factors that will be considered by ATC in approving random impromptu routes include the capability to provide radar monitoring and compatibility with traffic volume and flow. ATC will radar monitor each flight; however, navigation on the random impromptu route is the responsibility of the pilot. GNSS-equipped aircraft are allowed to operate in a non-radar environment when the aircraft is cleared via, or is reported to be established on, a point-to-point route. The points must be published NAVAIDs, waypoints, fixes, or airports recallable from the aircraft's database. The distance between the points cannot exceed 500 miles and navigational assistance will not be provided.
    2.  Pilots of aircraft equipped with approved area navigation equipment may file for RNAV routes throughout the National Airspace System and may be filed for in accordance with the following procedures.
        1.  File airport‐to‐airport flight plans.
        2.  File the appropriate aircraft equipment suffix in the flight plan.
        3.  Plan the random route portion of the flight plan to begin and end over appropriate arrival and departure transition fixes or appropriate navigation aids for the altitude stratum within which the flight will be conducted. The use of normal preferred departure and arrival routes (DP/STAR), where established, is recommended.
        4.  File route structure transitions to and from the random route portion of the flight.
        5.  Define the random route by waypoints. File route description waypoints by using degree‐ distance fixes based on navigational aids which are appropriate for the altitude stratum.
        6.  File a minimum of one route description waypoint for each ARTCC through whose area the random route will be flown.
        7.  File an additional route description waypoint for each turnpoint in the route.
        8.  Plan additional route description waypoints as required to ensure accurate navigation via the filed route of flight. Navigation is the pilot's responsibility unless ATC assistance is requested.
        9.  Plan the route of flight so as to avoid prohibited and restricted airspace by 3 NM unless permission has been obtained to operate in that airspace and the appropriate ATC facilities are advised.
            <div>

            <em>**NOTE-**</em>

            <em>To be approved for use in the National Airspace System, RNAV equipment must meet system availability, accuracy, and airworthiness standards. For additional information and guidance on RNAV equipment requirements, see Advisory Circular (AC) 20-138, Airworthiness Approval of Positioning and Navigation Systems, and AC 90-100, U.S. Terminal and En Route Area Navigation (RNAV) Operations.</em>

            </div>
    3.  Pilots of aircraft equipped with latitude/longitude coordinate navigation capability, independent of VOR/TACAN references, may file for random RNAV routes at and above FL 390 within the conterminous U.S. using the following procedures.
        1.  File airport‐to‐airport flight plans prior to departure.
        2.  File the appropriate RNAV capability certification suffix in the flight plan.
        3.  Plan the random route portion of the flight to begin and end over published departure/arrival transition fixes or appropriate navigation aids for airports without published transition procedures. The use of preferred departure and arrival routes, such as DP and STAR where established, is recommended.
        4.  Plan the route of flight so as to avoid prohibited and restricted airspace by 3 NM unless permission has been obtained to operate in that airspace and the appropriate ATC facility is advised.
        5.  Define the route of flight after the departure fix, including each intermediate fix (turnpoint) and the arrival fix for the destination airport in terms of latitude/longitude coordinates plotted to the nearest minute or in terms of Navigation Reference System (NRS) waypoints. For latitude/longitude filing the arrival fix must be identified by both the latitude/longitude coordinates and a fix identifier.
            <div>

            <em>**EXAMPLE-**</em>

            <em>MIA<sup>1</sup> SRQ<sup>2</sup> 3407/10615<sup>3</sup> 3407/11546 TNP<sup>4</sup> LAX <sup>5</sup></em>

            </div>
        6.  Record latitude/longitude coordinates by four figures describing latitude in degrees and minutes followed by a solidus and five figures describing longitude in degrees and minutes.
        7.  File at FL 390 or above for the random RNAV portion of the flight.
        8.  Fly all routes/route segments on Great Circle tracks or GPS-based tracks.
        9.  Make any inflight requests for random RNAV clearances or route amendments to an en route ATC facility.

**International Flight Plan (FAA Form 7233-4)- IFR Flights (For Domestic or International Flights) ^5-1-9**

1.  **General**  
    Use of FAA Form 7233-4 is:
    1.  Mandatory for assignment of RNAV SIDs and STARs or other PBN routing,
    2.  Mandatory for all IFR flights that will depart U.S. domestic airspace, and
    3.  Recommended for domestic IFR flights.
        <div>

        <em>**NOTE-**</em>

        1.  <em>An abbreviated description of FAA Form 7233-4 (International Flight Plan) may be found in this section. A detailed description of FAA Form 7233-4 may be found on the FAA website at:  
            <http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/enroute/flight_plan_filing/></em>
        2.  <em>Filers utilizing FAA Form 7233-1 (Flight Plan) may not be eligible for assignment of RNAV SIDs and STARs. Filers desiring assignment of these procedures should file using FAA Form 7233-4, as described in this section.</em>
        3.  <em>When filing an IFR flight plan using FAA Form 7233-4, it is recommended that filers include all operable navigation, communication, and surveillance equipment capabilities by adding appropriate equipment qualifiers as shown in Tables 5-1-3 and 5-1-4. These equipment qualifiers should be filed in Item 10 of FAA Form 7233-4.</em>
        4.  <em>ATC issues clearances based on aircraft capabilities filed in Items 10 and 18 of FAA Form 7233-4. Operators should file all capabilities for which the aircraft and crew is certified, capable, and authorized. PBN/ capability should be filed as per paragraph 5-1-9 b 8 Items 18 (c) and (d).</em>

        </div>
2.  **Explanation of Items Filed in FAA Form 7233-4**  
    Procedures and other information provided in this section are designed to assist operators using FAA Form 7233-4 to file IFR flight plans for flights that will be conducted entirely within U.S. domestic airspace. Requirements and procedures for operating outside U.S. domestic airspace may vary significantly from country to country. It is, therefore, recommended that operators planning flights outside U.S. domestic airspace become familiar with applicable international documents, including Aeronautical Information Publications (AIP); and ICAO Document 4444, Procedures for Air Navigation Services/Air Traffic Management, Appendix 2.

**IFR Operations to High Altitude Destinations ^5-1-10**

1.  Pilots planning IFR flights to airports located in mountainous terrain are cautioned to consider the necessity for an alternate airport even when the forecast weather conditions would technically relieve them from the requirement to file one.
    <div>

    <em>**REFERENCE-**</em>

    <em> 14 CFR Section 91.167.  
    [[04 Air Traffic Control/01 Services Available to Pilots#^4[[Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules.md#§91.167   Fuel requirements for flight in IFR conditions.|14 CFR Section 91.167]]4-1-19]], Tower En Route Control (TEC)  
    </em>

    </div>
2.  The FAA has identified three possible situations where the failure to plan for an alternate airport when flying IFR to such a destination airport could result in a critical situation if the weather is less than forecast and sufficient fuel is not available to proceed to a suitable airport.
    1.  An IFR flight to an airport where the Minimum Descent Altitudes (MDAs) or landing visibility minimums for <em>all instrument approaches</em> are higher than the forecast weather minimums specified in 14 CFR Section 91.167(b). For example, there are 3 high altitude airports in the U.S. wit[[Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules.md#§91.167   Fuel requirements for flight in IFR conditions.|14 CFR Section 91.167]] approach procedures where all of the MDAs are greater than 2,000 feet and/or the landing visibility minimums are greater than 3 miles (Bishop, California; South Lake Tahoe, California; and Aspen-Pitkin Co./Sardy Field, Colorado). In the case of these airports, it is possible for a pilot to elect, on the basis of forecasts, not to carry sufficient fuel to get to an alternate when the ceiling and/or visibility is actually lower than that necessary to complete the approach.
    2.  A small number of other airports in mountainous terrain have MDAs which are slightly (100 to 300 feet) below 2,000 feet AGL. In situations where there is an option as to whether to plan for an alternate, pilots should bear in mind that just a slight worsening of the weather conditions from those forecast could place the airport below the published IFR landing minimums.
    3.  An IFR flight to an airport which requires special equipment; i.e., DME, glide slope, etc., in order to make the available approaches to the lowest minimums. Pilots should be aware that all other minimums on the approach charts may require weather conditions better than those specified in 14 CFR Section 91.167(b). An inflight equipment malfunction could result in the inability to comply with the published approach procedures or, again, in the position of having the airport below the published IFR landing minimums for all remaining instrument approach alternatives.

**Flights Outside U.S. Territorial Airspace ^5-1-11**

1.  When conducting flights, particularly extended flights, outside the U.S. and its territories, full account should be taken of the amount and quality of air navigation services available in the airspace to be traversed. Every effort should be made to secure information on the location and range of navigational aids, availability of communications and meteorological services, the provision of air traffic services, including alerting service, and the existence of search and rescue services.
2.  Pilots should remember that there is a need to continuously guard the VHF emergency frequency 121.5 MHz when on long over‐water flights, except when communications on other VHF channels, equipment limitations, or cockpit duties prevent simultaneous guarding of two channels. Guarding of 121.5 MHz is particularly critical when operating in proximity to Flight Information Region (FIR) boundaries, for example, operations on Route R220 between Anchorage and Tokyo, since it serves to facilitate communications with regard to aircraft which may experience in‐flight emergencies, communications, or navigational difficulties.
    <div>

    <em>**REFERENCE-**</em>

    <em> ICAO Annex 10, Vol II, Paras 5.2.2.1.1.1 and 5.2.2.1.1.2. </em>

    </div>
3.  The filing of a flight plan, always good practice, takes on added significance for extended flights outside U.S. airspace and is, in fact, usually required by the laws of the countries being visited or overflown. It is also particularly important in the case of such flights that pilots leave a complete itinerary and schedule of the flight with someone directly concerned and keep that person advised of the flight's progress. If serious doubt arises as to the safety of the flight, that person should first contact the appropriate FSS. Round Robin Flight Plans to Canada and Mexico are not accepted.
4.  All pilots should review the foreign airspace and entry restrictions published in the appropriate Aeronautical Information Publication (AIP) during the flight planning process. Foreign airspace penetration without official authorization can involve both danger to the aircraft and the imposition of severe penalties and inconvenience to both passengers and crew. A flight plan on file with ATC authorities does not necessarily constitute the prior permission required by certain other authorities. The possibility of fatal consequences cannot be ignored in some areas of the world.
5.  Current NOTAMs for foreign locations must also be reviewed. International Notices regarding specific countries may be obtained through the Federal NOTAM System (FNS) NOTAM<em> </em>Search External Links or the Air Traffic Plans and Publications website. For additional flight information at foreign locations, pilots should also review the FAA's Prohibitions, Restrictions, and Notices website at <https://www.faa.gov/air_traffic/publications/us_restrictions/>.
6.  When customs notification to foreign locations is required, it is the responsibility of the pilot to arrange for customs notification in a timely manner.
7.  Aircraft arriving to locations in U.S. territorial airspace must meet the entry requirements as described in AIM Section 6, National Security and Interception Procedures.

**Change in Flight Plan ^5-1-12**

1.  In addition to altitude or flight level, destination and/or route changes, increasing or decreasing the speed of an aircraft constitutes a change in a flight plan. Therefore, at any time the average true airspeed at cruising altitude between reporting points varies or is expected to vary from that given in the flight plan by <em>plus or minus 5 percent, or 10 knots, whichever is greater,</em> ATC should be advised.
2.  All changes to existing flight plans should be completed more than 46 minutes prior to the proposed departure time. Changes must be made with the initial flight plan service provider. If the initial flight plan's service provider is unavailable, filers may contact an ATC facility or FSS to make the necessary revisions. Any revision 46 minutes or less from the proposed departure time must be coordinated through an ATC facility or FSS.

**Change in Proposed Departure Time ^5-1-13**

1.  To prevent computer saturation in the en route environment, parameters have been established to delete proposed departure flight plans which have not been activated. Most centers have this parameter set so as to delete these flight plans a minimum of 2 hours after the proposed departure time or Expect Departure Clearance Time (EDCT). To ensure that a flight plan remains active, pilots whose actual departure time will be delayed 2 hours or more beyond their filed departure time, are requested to notify ATC of their new proposed departure time.
2.  Due to traffic saturation, ATC personnel frequently will be unable to accept these revisions via radio. It is recommended that you forward these revisions to a flight plan service provider or FSS.

**Closing VFR/DVFR Flight Plans ^5-1-14** A pilot is responsible for ensuring that his/her VFR or DVFR flight plan is canceled. You should close your flight plan with the nearest FSS, or if one is not available, you may request any ATC facility to relay your cancellation to the FSS.<em> </em>Control towers do not automatically close VFR or DVFR flight plans since they do not know if a particular VFR aircraft is on a flight plan.

**Canceling IFR Fligh[[Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules.md#§91.153   VFR flight plan: Information required.|14 CFR Section 91.153]].  14[[Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0091 General operating and flight rules.md#§91.169   IFR flight plan: Information required.|14 CFR Section 91.169]]and 91.169 include the statement “When a flight plan has been activated, the pilot‐in‐command, upon canceling or completing the flight under the flight plan, must notify an FAA Flight Service Station or ATC facility.”
2.  An IFR flight plan may be canceled at any time the flight is operating in VFR conditions outside Class A airspace by pilots stating “CANCEL MY IFR FLIGHT PLAN” to the controller or air/ground station with which they are communicating. Immediately after canceling an IFR flight plan, a pilot should take the necessary action to change to the appropriate air/ground frequency, VFR radar beacon code and VFR altitude or flight level.
3.  ATC separation and information services will be discontinued, including radar services (where applicable). Consequently, if the canceling flight desires VFR radar advisory service, the pilot must specifically request it.
    <div>

    <em>**NOTE-**</em>

    <em>Pilots must be aware that other procedures may be applicable to a flight that cancels an IFR flight plan within an area where a special program, such as a designated TRSA, Class C airspace, or Class B airspace, has been established.</em>

    </div>
4.  If a DVFR flight plan requirement exists, the pilot is responsible for filing this flight plan to replace the canceled IFR flight plan. If a subsequent IFR operation becomes necessary, a new IFR flight plan must be filed and an ATC clearance obtained before operating in IFR conditions.
5.  If operating on an IFR flight plan to an airport with a functioning control tower, the flight plan is automatically closed upon landing.
6.  If operating on an IFR flight plan to an airport where there is no functioning control tower, the pilot must initiate cancellation of the IFR flight plan. This can be done after landing if there is a functioning FSS or other means of direct communications with ATC. In the event there is no FSS and/or air/ground communications with ATC is not possible below a certain altitude, the pilot should, weather conditions permitting, cancel the IFR flight plan while still airborne and able to communicate with ATC by radio. This will not only save the time and expense of canceling the flight plan by telephone but will quickly release the airspace for use by other aircraft.

**RNAV and RNP Operations ^5-1-16**

1.  During the pre-flight planning phase the availability of the navigation infrastructure required for the intended operation, including any non-RNAV contingencies, must be confirmed for the period of intended operation. Availability of the onboard navigation equipment necessary for the route to be flown must be confirmed.
2.  If a pilot determines a specified RNP level cannot be achieved, revise the route or delay the operation until appropriate RNP level can be ensured.
3.  The onboard navigation database must be current and appropriate for the region of intended operation and must include the navigation aids, waypoints, and coded terminal airspace procedures for the departure, arrival and alternate airfields.
4.  During system initialization, pilots of aircraft equipped with a Flight Management System or other RNAV-certified system, must confirm that the navigation database is current, and verify that the aircraft position has been entered correctly. Flight crews should crosscheck the cleared flight plan against charts or other applicable resources, as well as the navigation system textual display and the aircraft map display. This process includes confirmation of the waypoints sequence, reasonableness of track angles and distances, any altitude or speed constraints, and identification of fly-by or fly-over waypoints. A procedure must not be used if validity of the navigation database is in doubt.
5.  Prior to commencing takeoff, the flight crew must verify that the RNAV system is operating correctly and the correct airport and runway data have been loaded.
6.  During the pre-flight planning phase RAIM prediction must be performed if TSO-C129() equipment is used to solely satisfy the RNAV and RNP requirement. GPS RAIM availability must be confirmed for the intended route of flight (route and time) using current GPS satellite information. In the event of a predicted, continuous loss of RAIM of more than five (5) minutes for any part of the intended flight, the flight should be delayed, canceled, or re-routed where RAIM requirements can be met. Operators may satisfy the predictive RAIM requirement through any one of the following methods:
    1.  Operators may monitor the status of each satellite in its plane/slot position, by accounting for the latest GPS constellation status (for example, NOTAMs or NANUs), and compute RAIM availability using model-specific RAIM prediction software;
    2.  Operators may use the Service Availability Prediction Tool (SAPT) on the FAA en route and terminal RAIM prediction website;
    3.  Operators may contact a Flight Service Station to obtain non-precision approach RAIM;
    4.  Operators may use a third party interface, incorporating FAA/VOLPE RAIM prediction data without altering performance values, to predict RAIM outages for the aircraft's predicted flight path and times;
    5.  Operators may use the receiver's installed RAIM prediction capability (for TSO-C129a/Class A1/B1/C1 equipment) to provide non-precision approach RAIM, accounting for the latest GPS constellation status (for example, NOTAMs or NANUs). Receiver non-precision approach RAIM should be checked at airports spaced at intervals not to exceed 60 NM along the RNAV 1 procedure's flight track. “Terminal” or “Approach” RAIM must be available at the ETA over each airport checked; or,
    6.  Operators not using model-specific software or FAA/VOLPE RAIM data will need FAA operational approval.
        <div>

        <em>**NOTE-**</em>

        <em>If TSO-C145/C146 equipment is used to satisfy the RNAV and RNP requirement, the pilot/operator need not perform the prediction if WAAS coverage is confirmed to be available along the entire route of flight. Outside the U.S. or in areas where WAAS coverage is not available, operators using TSO-C145/C146 receivers are required to check GPS RAIM availability.</em>

**Cold Temperature Operations ^5-1-17** Pilots should begin planning for operating into airports with cold temperatures during the preflight planning phase. Instrument approach charts will contain a snowflake symbol and a temperature when cold temperature correction must be applied. Pilots operating into airports requiring cold temperature corrections should request the lowest forecast temperature at the airport for departure and arrival times. If the temperature is forecast to be at or below any published cold temperature restriction, calculate an altitude correction for the appropriate segment(s) and/or review procedures for operating automatic cold temperature compensating systems, as applicable. The pilot is responsible to calculate and apply the corrections to the affected segment(s) when the actual reported temperature is at or below any published cold temperature restriction, or pilots with automatic cold temperature compensating systems must ensure the system is on and operating on each designated segment. Advise ATC when intending to apply cold temperature correction and of the amount of correction required on initial contact (or as soon as possible) for the intermediate segment and/or the published missed approach. This information is required for ATC to provide aircraft appropriate vertical separation between known traffic.
