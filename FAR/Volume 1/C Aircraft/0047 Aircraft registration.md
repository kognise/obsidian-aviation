### §47.3   Registration required.

\(a\) An aircraft may be registered under 49 U.S.C. 44103 only when the aircraft is not registered under the laws of a foreign country and is—

\(1\) Owned by a citizen of the United States;

\(2\) Owned by an individual citizen of a foreign country lawfully admitted for permanent residence in the United States;

\(ii\) A State, the District of Columbia, a territory or possession of the United States, or a political subdivision of a State, territory, or possession.

\(b\) No person may operate an aircraft that is eligible for registration under 49 U.S.C. 44101-44104, unless the aircraft—

\(1\) Has been registered by its owner;

\(2\) Is carrying aboard the temporary authorization required by [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.31   Application.|§47.31]](c); or

The FAA issues a Certificate of Aircraft Registration, AC Form 8050-3 to the person who appears to be the owner on the basis of the evidence of ownership submitted pursuant to [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.11   Evidence of ownership.|§47.11]] with the Aircraft Registration Application, or recorded at the Registry.

\(c\) *Trustees.* An applicant for aircraft registration under 49 U.S.C. 44102 that holds legal title to an aircraft in trust must comply with the following requirements:

\(1\) Each trustee must be either a U.S. citizen or a resident alien.

\(2\) The applicant must submit with the Aircraft Registration Application—

\(i\) A copy of each document legally affecting a relationship under the trust;

\(ii\) If each beneficiary under the trust, including each person whose security interest in the aircraft is incorporated in the trust, is either a U.S. citizen or a resident alien, an affidavit by the applicant to that effect; and

\(iii\) If any beneficiary under the trust, including any person whose security interest in the aircraft is incorporated in the trust, is not a U.S. citizen or resident alien, an affidavit from each trustee stating that the trustee is not aware of any reason, situation, or relationship (involving beneficiaries or other persons who are not U.S. citizens or resident aliens) as a result of which those persons together would have more than 25 percent of the aggregate power to influence or limit the exercise of the trustee's authority.

\(3\) If persons who are neither U.S. citizens nor resident aliens have the power to direct or remove a trustee, either directly or indirectly through the control of another person, the trust instrument must provide that those persons together may not have more than 25 percent of the aggregate power to direct or remove a trustee. Nothing in this paragraph prevents those persons from having more than 25 percent of the beneficial interest in the trust.

\(d\) *Partnerships.* A partnership may apply for a Certificate of Aircraft Registration, AC Form 8050-3, under 49 U.S.C. 44102 only if each partner, whether a general or limited partner, is an individual who is a citizen of the United States. Nothing in this section makes ineligible for registration an aircraft which is not owned as a partnership asset but is co-owned by—

\(1\) Resident aliens; or

\(2\) One or more resident aliens and one or more U.S. citizens.

\[Amdt. 47-20, 44 FR 61939, Oct. 29, 1979, as amended by Amdt. 47-27, 70 FR 244, Jan. 3, 2005; Amdt. 47-29, 75 FR 41980, July 20, 2010; Doc. No. FAA-2015-7396; Amdt. 47-30, 80 FR 78645, Dec. 16, 2015\]

### §47.8   Voting trusts.

\(a\) If a voting trust is used to qualify a domestic corporation as a U.S. citizen, the corporate applicant must submit to the Registry—

\(1\) A true copy of the fully executed voting trust agreement, which must identify each voting interest of the applicant, and which must be binding upon each voting trustee, the applicant corporation, all foreign stockholders, and each other party to the transaction; and

\(2\) An affidavit executed by each person designated as voting trustee in the voting trust agreement, in which each affiant represents—

\(i\) That each voting trustee is a citizen of the United States within the meaning of 49 U.S.C. 40102(a)(15).

\(iii\) That each voting trustee is not a present or prospective beneficiary, creditor, debtor, supplier or contractor of any other party to the trust agreement;

\(iv\) That each voting trustee is not aware of any reason, situation, or relationship under which any other party to the agreement might influence the exercise of the voting trustee's totally independent judgment under the voting trust agreement.

\(b\) Each voting trust agreement submitted under paragraph (a)(1) of this section must provide for the succession of a voting trustee in the event of death, disability, resignation, termination of citizenship, or any other event leading to the replacement of any voting trustee. Upon succession, the replacement voting trustee shall immediately submit to the Registry the affidavit required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

\(c\) If the voting trust terminates or is modified, and the result is less than 75 percent control of the voting interest in the corporation by citizens of the United States, a loss of citizenship of the holder of the Certificate of Aircraft Registration, AC Form 8050-3 occurs, and [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.41   Duration and return of Certificate.|§47.41]](a)(3) of this part applies.

\(d\) A voting trust agreement may not empower a trustee to act through a proxy.

\[Amdt. 47-20, 44 FR 61939, Oct. 29, 1979, as amended by Amdt. 47-27, 70 FR 245, Jan. 3, 2005; Amdt. 47-29, 75 FR 41980, July 20, 2010\]

\(2\) For aircraft registered after January 1, 1980, the period consisting in the remainder of the registration month and the succeeding 6 calendar months and each 6-calendar month period thereafter.

\(c\) For the purpose of this section, only those flight hours accumulated during non-stop (except for stops in emergencies or for purposes of refueling) flight between two points in the United States, even if the aircraft is outside of the United States during part of the flight, are considered flight hours accumulated within the United States.

\(d\) In determining compliance with this section, any periods during which the aircraft is not validly registered in the United States are disregarded.

\(e\) The corporation that registers an aircraft pursuant to 49 U.S.C. 44102 shall maintain, and make available for inspection by the FAA upon request, records containing the total flight hours in the United States of the aircraft for three calendar years after the year in which the flight hours were accumulated.

### §47.15   Registration number.

\(a\) *Number required.* An applicant for aircraft registration must place a U.S. registration number (registration mark) on the Aircraft Registration Application, AC Form 8050-1, and on any evidence submitted with the application. There is no charge for the assignment of numbers provided in this paragraph. This paragraph does not apply to an aircraft manufacturer who applies for a group of U.S. registration numbers under paragraph (c) of this section; a person who applies for a special registration number under paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section; or a holder of a Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificate, AC Form 8050-6, who applies for a temporary registration number under [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.16   Temporary registration numbers.|§47.16]].

\(1\) *Aircraft not previously registered anywhere.* The applicant must obtain the U.S. registration number from the Registry by request in writing describing the aircraft by make, type, model, and serial number (or, if it is amateur-built, as provided in [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.33   Aircraft not previously registered anywhere.|§47.33]](b)) and stating that the aircraft has not previously been registered anywhere. If the aircraft was brought into the United States from a foreign country, the applicant must submit evidence that the aircraft has never been registered in a foreign country.

\(2\) *Aircraft last previously registered in the United States.* Unless the applicant applies for a different number under paragraphs (d) through (f) of this section, the applicant must place the U.S. registration number that is already assigned to the aircraft on the Aircraft Registration Application, and the supporting evidence. If there is no number assigned, the applicant must obtain a U.S. registration number from the Registry by making a written request that describes the aircraft by make, model, and serial number.

\(3\) *Aircraft last previously registered in a foreign country.* Whether or not the foreign registration has ended, the applicant must obtain a U.S. registration number from the Registry for an aircraft last previously registered in a foreign country, by request in writing describing the aircraft by make, model, and serial number, accompanied by—

\(i\) Evidence of termination of foreign registration in accordance with [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.37   Aircraft last previously registered in a foreign country.|§47.37]](b) or the applicant's affidavit showing that foreign registration has ended; or

\(ii\) If foreign registration has not ended, the applicant's affidavit stating that the number will not be placed on the aircraft until foreign registration has ended.

\(4\) *Duration of a U.S. registration number assignment.* Authority to use the registration number obtained under paragraph (a)(1), (2), or (3) of this section expires 90 days after the date it is issued unless the applicant submits an Aircraft Registration Application and complies with [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.33   Aircraft not previously registered anywhere.|§47.33]] or [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.37   Aircraft last previously registered in a foreign country.|§47.37]], as applicable, within that period of time. However, the applicant may obtain an extension of this 90-day period from the Registry if the applicant shows that the delay in complying with that section is due to circumstances beyond the applicant's control.

\(b\) A U.S. registration number may not exceed five symbols in addition to the prefix letter “N”. These symbols may be all numbers (N10000), one to four numbers and one suffix letter (N 1000A), or one to three numbers and two suffix letters (N 100AB). The letters “I” and “O” may not be used. The first zero in a number must always be preceded by at least one of the numbers 1 through 9.

\(c\) An aircraft manufacturer may apply to the Registry for enough U.S. registration numbers to supply estimated production for the next 18 months. There is no charge for this allocation of numbers.

\(d\) Any available, unassigned U.S. registration number may be assigned as a special registration number. An applicant who wants a special registration number or wants to change the registration number of his aircraft may apply for it to the Registry. The fee required by [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.17   Fees.|§47.17]] must accompany the application.

\(e\) \[Reserved\]

\(f\) The Registry authorizes a special registration number change on the Assignment of Special Registration Numbers, AC Form 8050-64. The authorization expires one year from the date the Registry issues an Assignment of Special Registration Numbers unless the special registration number is permanently placed on the aircraft. Within five days after the special registration number is placed on the aircraft, the owner must complete and sign the Assignment of Special Registration Numbers, state the date the number was placed on the aircraft, and return the original form to the Registry. The duplicate of the Assignment of Special Registration Numbers and the present Certificate of Aircraft Registration, AC Form 8050-3, must be carried in the aircraft as temporary authority to operate it. This temporary authority is valid until the date the owner receives the revised Certificate of Aircraft Registration showing the new registration number, but in no case is it valid for more than 120 days from the date the number is placed on the aircraft.

\(g\) \[Reserved\]

\(h\) A special registration number may be reserved for no more than 1 year. If a person wishes to renew his reservation from year to year, he must apply to the Registry for renewal and submit the fee required by [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.17   Fees.|§47.17]] for a special registration number.

\(i\) When aircraft registration has ended, as described in [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.41   Duration and return of Certificate.|§47.41]](a), the assignment of a registration number to an aircraft is no longer authorized for use except as provided in [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.31   Application.|§47.31]](c) and will be cancelled:

\(1\) Following the date established in [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.40   Registration expiration and renewal.|§47.40]](a)(1) for any aircraft that has not been re-registered under [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.40   Registration expiration and renewal.|§47.40]](a);

\(2\) Following the expiration date shown on the Certificate of Aircraft Registration for any aircraft whose registration has not been renewed under [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.40   Registration expiration and renewal.|§47.40]](c);

\(3\) Following the expiration date shown on the Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificate, AC Form 8050-6, for any aircraft registered under Subpart C of this part, when the certificate has not been renewed, and the owner has not applied for registration in accordance with [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.31   Application.|§47.31]]; or

\(4\) When ownership has transferred—

\(i\) Six months after first receipt of notice of aircraft sale or evidence of ownership from the last registered owner or successive owners, and an Aircraft Registration Application has not been received.

\(ii\) Six months after evidence of ownership authorized under [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.67   Evidence of ownership.|§47.67]] has been submitted, and the applicant has not met the requirements of this part.

\(iii\) Twelve months after a new owner has submitted evidence of ownership and an Aircraft Registration Application under [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.31   Application.|§47.31]], and the applicant or a successive applicant has not met the requirements of this part.

\(j\) At the time an assignment of registration number is cancelled, the number may be reserved for one year in the name of the last owner of record if a request has been submitted with the fee required by [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.17   Fees.|§47.17]].

### §47.16   Temporary registration numbers.

\(a\) Temporary registration numbers are issued by the FAA to manufacturers, distributors, and dealers who are holders of Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificates, AC Form 8050-6, for temporary display on aircraft during flight allowed under Subpart C of this part.

\(b\) The holder of a Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificate may apply to the Registry for as many temporary registration numbers as are necessary for his business. The application must be in writing and include—

\(1\) Sufficient information to justify the need for the temporary registration numbers requested; and

\(2\) The number of each Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificate held by the applicant.

\(c\) The use of temporary registration numbers is subject to the following conditions:

\(1\) The numbers may be used and reused—

\(i\) Only in connection with the holder's Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificate;

\(ii\) Within the limitations of [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.69   Limitations.|§47.69]] where applicable, including the requirements of [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0047 Aircraft registration.md#§47.67   Evidence of ownership.|§47.67]]; and

\(iii\) On aircraft not registered under Subpart B of this part or in a foreign country, and not displaying any other identification markings.

\(2\) A temporary registration number may not be used on more than one aircraft in flight at the same time.

\(3\) Temporary registration numbers may not be used to fly aircraft into the United States for the purpose of importation.

\(d\) The assignment of any temporary registration number to any person lapses upon the expiration of all of his Dealer's Aircraft Registration Certificates. When a temporary registration number is used on a flight outside the United States for delivery purposes, the holder shall record the assignment of that number to the aircraft and shall keep that record for at least 1 year after the removal of the number from that aircraft. Whenever the owner of an aircraft bearing a temporary registration number applies for an airworthiness certificate under [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0021 Certification procedures for products and articles.md|Part 21 of this chapter]] he shall furnish that number in the application. The temporary registration number must be removed from the aircraft not later than the date on which either title or possession passes to another person.

\(1\) This temporary authority is valid for operation within the United States until the date the applicant receives the Certificate of Aircraft Registration or until the date the FAA denies the application, but in no case for more than 90 days after the date the applicant signs the application. If by 90 days after the date the applicant signs the Aircraft Registration Application, the FAA has neither issued the Certificate of Aircraft Registration nor denied the application, the Registry will issue a letter of extension that serves as authority to continue to operate the aircraft without registration while it is carried in the aircraft.

\(2\) This temporary authority is not available in connection with any Aircraft Registration Application received when 12 months have passed since the receipt of the first application following transfer of ownership by the last registered owner.

\(3\) If there is no registration number assigned at the time application for registration is made, the second copy of the Aircraft Registration Application may not be used as temporary authority to operate the aircraft.
