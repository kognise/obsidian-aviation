\(1\) Each occupant's seat must have a combined safety belt and shoulder harness with a single-point release. Each pilot's combined safety belt and shoulder harness must allow each pilot, when seated with safety belt and shoulder harness fastened, to perform all functions necessary for flight operations. There must be a means to secure belts and harnesses, when not in use, to prevent interference with the operation of the rotorcraft and with rapid egress in an emergency.

\(2\) Each occupant must be protected from serious head injury by a safety belt plus a shoulder harness that will prevent the head from contacting any injurious object.

\(3\) The safety belt and shoulder harness must meet the static and dynamic strength requirements, if applicable, specified by the rotorcraft type certification basis.

\(4\) For purposes of this section, the date of manufacture is either—

\(i\) The date the inspection acceptance records, or equivalent, reflect that the rotorcraft is complete and meets the FAA-Approved Type Design Data; or

\(ii\) The date the foreign civil airworthiness authority certifies that the rotorcraft is complete and issues an original standard airworthiness certificate, or equivalent, in that country.

\(b\) For rotorcraft with a certification basis established prior to October 18, 1999—

\(1\) The maximum passenger seat capacity may be increased to eight or nine provided the applicant shows compliance with all the airworthiness requirements of this part in effect on October 18, 1999.

\(2\) The maximum weight may be increased to greater than 6,000 pounds provided—

\(i\) The number of passenger seats is not increased above the maximum number certificated on October 18, 1999, or

### §27.31   Removable ballast.

Removable ballast may be used in showing compliance with the flight requirements of this subpart.

### §27.33   Main rotor speed and pitch limits.

\(a\) *Main rotor speed limits.* A range of main rotor speeds must be established that—

\(1\) With power on, provides adequate margin to accommodate the variations in rotor speed occurring in any appropriate maneuver, and is consistent with the kind of governor or synchronizer used; and

\(2\) With power off, allows each appropriate autorotative maneuver to be performed throughout the ranges of airspeed and weight for which certification is requested.

\(b\) *Normal main rotor high pitch limits (power on).* For rotocraft, except helicopters required to have a main rotor low speed warning under paragraph (e) of this section. It must be shown, with power on and without exceeding approved engine maximum limitations, that main rotor speeds substantially less than the minimum approved main rotor speed will not occur under any sustained flight condition. This must be met by—

\(1\) Appropriate setting of the main rotor high pitch stop;

\(2\) Inherent rotorcraft characteristics that make unsafe low main rotor speeds unlikely; or

\(3\) Adequate means to warn the pilot of unsafe main rotor speeds.

\(c\) *Normal main rotor low pitch limits (power off).* It must be shown, with power off, that—

\(1\) The normal main rotor low pitch limit provides sufficient rotor speed, in any autorotative condition, under the most critical combinations of weight and airspeed; and

\(2\) It is possible to prevent overspeeding of the rotor without exceptional piloting skill.

\(d\) *Emergency high pitch.* If the main rotor high pitch stop is set to meet paragraph (b)(1) of this section, and if that stop cannot be exceeded inadvertently, additional pitch may be made available for emergency use.

\(e\) *Main rotor low speed warning for helicopters.* For each single engine helicopter, and each multiengine helicopter that does not have an approved device that automatically increases power on the operating engines when one engine fails, there must be a main rotor low speed warning which meets the following requirements:

\(1\) The warning must be furnished to the pilot in all flight conditions, including power-on and power-off flight, when the speed of a main rotor approaches a value that can jeopardize safe flight.

\(2\) The warning may be furnished either through the inherent aerodynamic qualities of the helicopter or by a device.

\(3\) The warning must be clear and distinct under all conditons, and must be clearly distinguishable from all other warnings. A visual device that requires the attention of the crew within the cockpit is not acceptable by itself.

\(4\) If a warning device is used, the device must automatically deactivate and reset when the low-speed condition is corrected. If the device has an audible warning, it must also be equipped with a means for the pilot to manually silence the audible warning before the low-speed condition is corrected.

\(b\) The performance must correspond to the engine power available under the particular ambient atmospheric conditions, the particular flight condition, and the relative humidity specified in paragraphs (d) or (e) of this section, as appropriate.

\(c\) The available power must correspond to engine power, not exceeding the approved power, less—

\(1\) Installation losses; and

\(2\) The power absorbed by the accessories and services appropriate to the particular ambient atmopheric conditions and the particular flight condition.

\(d\) For reciprocating engine-powered rotorcraft, the performance, as affected by engine power, must be based on a relative humidity of 80 percent in a standard atmosphere.

\(e\) For turbine engine-powered rotorcraft, the performance, as affected by engine power, must be based on a relative humidity of—

\(1\) 80 percent, at and below standard temperature; and

\(2\) 34 percent, at and above standard temperature plus 50 degrees F. Between these two temperatures, the relative humidity must vary linearly.

The flight conditions must be selected so the maximum design loads are obtained on each surface. In the absence of more rational data, the unsymmetrical horizontal tail surface loading distributions described in this section must be assumed.

\(a\) *Forward speed landing conditions.* The rotorcraft must initially contact the most critical wave for reasonably probable water conditions at forward velocities from zero up to 30 knots in likely pitch, roll, and yaw attitudes. The rotorcraft limit vertical descent velocity may not be less than 5 feet per second relative to the mean water surface. Rotor lift may be used to act through the center of gravity throughout the landing impact. This lift may not exceed two-thirds of the design maximum weight. A maximum forward velocity of less than 30 knots may be used in design if it can be demonstrated that the forward velocity selected would not be exceeded in a normal one-engine-out touchdown.

\(b\) *Auxiliary or emergency float conditions*—(1) *Floats fixed or deployed before initial water contact.* In addition to the landing loads in paragraph (a) of this section, each auxiliary or emergency float, of its support and attaching structure in the airframe or fuselage, must be designed for the load developed by a fully immersed float unless it can be shown that full immersion is unlikely. If full immersion is unlikely, the highest likely float buoyancy load must be applied. The highest likely buoyancy load must include consideration of a partially immersed float creating restoring moments to compensate the upsetting moments caused by side wind, unsymmetrical rotorcraft loading, water wave action, rotorcraft inertia, and probable structural damage and leakage considered under [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0027 Airworthiness standards  normal category rotorcraft.md#§27.801   Ditching.|§27.801]](d). Maximum roll and pitch angles determined from compliance with [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0027 Airworthiness standards  normal category rotorcraft.md#§27.801   Ditching.|§27.801]](d) may be used, if significant, to determine the extent of immersion of each float. If the floats are deployed in flight, appropriate air loads derived from the flight limitations with the floats deployed shall be used in substantiation of the floats and their attachment to the rotorcraft. For this purpose, the design airspeed for limit load is the float deployed airspeed operating limit multiplied by 1.11.

\(2\) *Floats deployed after initial water contact.* Each float must be designed for full or partial immersion perscribed in paragraph (b)(1) of this section. In addition, each float must be designed for combined vertical and drag loads using a relative limit speed of 20 knots between the rotorcraft and the water. The vertical load may not be less than the highest likely buoyancy load determined under paragraph (b)(1) of this section.

\(3\) It must be shown that the interval determined under paragraph (d)(2) of this section is long enough, in relation to the inspection intervals and related procedures furnished under section A27.4 of appendix A, to provide a probability of detection great enough to ensure that the probability of catastrophic failure is extremely remote.

\(e\) *Combination of replacement time and failsafe evaluations.* A component may be evaluated under a combination of paragraphs (c) and (d) of this section. For such component it must be shown that the probability of catastrophic failure is extremely remote with an approved combination of replacement time, inspection intervals, and related procedures furnished under section A27.4 of appendix A.

\(b\) The methodology used to establish compliance with this section must be submitted to and approved by the Administrator.

\(c\) Definitions:

\(1\) *Catastrophic failure* is an event that could prevent continued safe flight and landing.

\(2\) *Principal Structural Elements (PSEs)* are structural elements that contribute significantly to the carrying of flight or ground loads, the failure of which could result in catastrophic failure of the rotorcraft.

\(3\) *Threat Assessment* is an assessment that specifies the locations, types, and sizes of damage, considering fatigue, environmental effects, intrinsic and discrete flaws, and impact or other accidental damage (including the discrete source of the accidental damage) that may occur during manufacture or operation.

\(d\) Damage Tolerance Evaluation:

\(1\) Each applicant must show that catastrophic failure due to static and fatigue loads, considering the intrinsic or discrete manufacturing defects or accidental damage, is avoided throughout the operational life or prescribed inspection intervals of the rotorcraft by performing damage tolerance evaluations of the strength of composite PSEs and other parts, detail design points, and fabrication techniques. Each applicant must account for the effects of material and process variability along with environmental conditions in the strength and fatigue evaluations. Each applicant must evaluate parts that include PSEs of the airframe, main and tail rotor drive systems, main and tail rotor blades and hubs, rotor controls, fixed and movable control surfaces, engine and transmission mountings, landing gear, other parts, detail design points, and fabrication techniques deemed critical by the FAA. Each damage tolerance evaluation must include:

\(i\) The identification of all PSEs;

\(ii\) In-flight and ground measurements for determining the loads or stresses for all PSEs for all critical conditions throughout the range of limits in [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0027 Airworthiness standards  normal category rotorcraft.md#§27.309   Design limitations.|§27.309]] (including altitude effects), except that maneuvering load factors need not exceed the maximum values expected in service;

\(iii\) The loading spectra as severe as those expected in service based on loads or stresses determined under paragraph (d)(1)(ii) of this section, including external load operations, if applicable, and other operations including high-torque events;

\(iv\) A threat assessment for all PSEs that specifies the locations, types, and sizes of damage, considering fatigue, environmental effects, intrinsic and discrete flaws, and impact or other accidental damage (including the discrete source of the accidental damage) that may occur during manufacture or operation; and

\(v\) An assessment of the residual strength and fatigue characteristics of all PSEs that supports the replacement times and inspection intervals established under paragraph (d)(2) of this section.

\(2\) Each applicant must establish replacement times, inspections, or other procedures for all PSEs to require the repair or replacement of damaged parts before a catastrophic failure. These replacement times, inspections, or other procedures must be included in the Airworthiness Limitations Section of the Instructions for Continued Airworthiness required by [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0027 Airworthiness standards  normal category rotorcraft.md#§27.1529   Instructions for Continued Airworthiness.|§27.1529]].

\(i\) Replacement times for PSEs must be determined by tests, or by analysis supported by tests, and must show that the structure is able to withstand the repeated loads of variable magnitude expected in-service. In establishing these replacement times, the following items must be considered:

\(A\) Damage identified in the threat assessment required by paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section;

\(B\) Maximum acceptable manufacturing defects and in-service damage (*i.e.*, those that do not lower the residual strength below ultimate design loads and those that can be repaired to restore ultimate strength); and

\(C\) Ultimate load strength capability after applying repeated loads.

The load for any rotorcraft-load combination class, for any external cargo type, must be applied in the vertical direction. For jettisonable external loads of any applicable external cargo type, the load must also be applied in any direction making the maximum angle with the vertical that can be achieved in service but not less than 30°. However, the 30° angle may be reduced to a lesser angle if—

\(5\) Have the appropriate limitations and procedures incorporated in the flight manual for conducting human external cargo operations.

\(d\) The critically configured jettisonable external loads must be shown by a combination of analysis, ground tests, and flight tests to be both transportable and releasable throughout the approved operational envelope without hazard to the rotorcraft during normal flight conditions. In addition, these external loads must be shown to be releasable without hazard to the rotorcraft during emergency flight conditions.

\(e\) A placard or marking must be installed next to the external-load attaching means clearly stating any operational limitations and the maximum authorized external load as demonstrated under [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0027 Airworthiness standards  normal category rotorcraft.md#§27.25   Weight limits.|§27.25]] and this section.

\(f\) The fatigue evaluation of [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0027 Airworthiness standards  normal category rotorcraft.md#§27.571   Fatigue evaluation of flight structure.|§27.571]] of this part does not apply to rotorcraft-load combinations to be used for nonhuman external cargo except for the failure of critical structural elements that would result in a hazard to the rotorcraft. For rotorcraft-load combinations to be used for human external cargo, the fatigue evaluation of [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0027 Airworthiness standards  normal category rotorcraft.md#§27.571   Fatigue evaluation of flight structure.|§27.571]] of this part applies to the entire quick release and personnel carrying device structural systems and their attachments.

\(1\) For multiengine rotorcraft for which the use of 21⁄2 minute OEI power is requested, 12 runs during the 10-hour test must be conducted as follows:

\(i\) Each run must consist of at least one period of 21⁄2 minutes with takeoff torque and the maximum speed for use with takeoff torque on all engines.

\(i\) Immediately following a takeoff run of at least 5 minutes, each power source must simulate a failure, in turn, and apply the maximum torque and the maximum speed for use with 30-second OEI power to the remaining affected drive system power inputs for not less than 30 seconds, followed by application of the maximum torque and the maximum speed for use with 2-minute OEI power for not less than 2 minutes. At least one run sequence must be conducted from a simulated “flight idle” condition. When conducted on a bench test, the test sequence must be conducted following stabilization at takeoff power.

\(h\) Under the operating conditions specified in paragraph (c) of this section, 500 complete cycles of lateral control, 500 complete cycles of longitudinal control of the main rotors, and 500 complete cycles of control of each auxiliary rotor must be accomplished. A “complete cycle” involves movement of the controls from the neutral position, through both extreme positions, and back to the neutral position, except that control movements need not produce loads or flapping motions exceeding the maximum loads or motions encountered in flight. The cycling may be accomplished during the testing prescribed in paragraph (c) of this section.

\(i\) At least 200 start-up clutch engagements must be accomplished—

\(1\) So that the shaft on the driven side of the clutch is accelerated; and

\(2\) Using a speed and method selected by the applicant.

### §27.927   Additional tests.

\(a\) Any additional dynamic, endurance, and operational tests, and vibratory investigations necessary to determine that the rotor drive mechanism is safe, must be performed.

\(b\) If turbine engine torque output to the transmission can exceed the highest engine or transmission torque rating limit, and that output is not directly controlled by the pilot under normal operating conditions (such as where the primary engine power control is accomplished through the flight control), the following test must be made:

\(1\) Under conditions associated with all engines operating, make 200 applications, for 10 seconds each, or torque that is at least equal to the lesser of—

\(i\) The maximum torque used in meeting [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0027 Airworthiness standards  normal category rotorcraft.md#§27.923   Rotor drive system and control mechanism tests.|§27.923]] plus 10 percent; or

\(2\) For multiengine rotorcraft under conditions associated with each engine, in turn, becoming inoperative, apply to the remaining transmission torque inputs the maximum torque attainable under probable operating conditions, assuming that torque limiting devices, if any, function properly. Each transmission input must be tested at this maximum torque for at least 15 minutes.

\(3\) The tests prescribed in this paragraph must be conducted on the rotorcraft at the maximum rotational speed intended for the power condition of the test and the torque must be absorbed by the rotors to be installed, except that other ground or flight test facilities with other appropriate methods of torque absorption may be used if the conditions of support and vibration closely simulate the conditions that would exist during a test on the rotorcraft.

\(c\) It must be shown by tests that the rotor drive system is capable of operating under autorotative conditions for 15 minutes after the loss of pressure in the rotor drive primary oil system.

### §27.931   Shafting critical speed.

\(a\) The critical speeds of any shafting must be determined by demonstration except that analytical methods may be used if reliable methods of analysis are available for the particular design.

\(b\) If any critical speed lies within, or close to, the operating ranges for idling, power on, and autorotative conditions, the stresses occurring at that speed must be within safe limits. This must be shown by tests.

\(c\) If analytical methods are used and show that no critical speed lies within the permissible operating ranges, the margins between the calculated critical speeds and the limits of the allowable operating ranges must be adequate to allow for possible variations between the computed and actual values.

### §27.952   Fuel system crash resistance.

Unless other means acceptable to the Administrator are employed to minimize the hazard of fuel fires to occupants following an otherwise survivable impact (crash landing), the fuel systems must incorporate the design features of this section. These systems must be shown to be capable of sustaining the static and dynamic deceleration loads of this section, considered as ultimate loads acting alone, measured at the system component's center of gravity, without structural damage to system components, fuel tanks, or their attachments that would leak fuel to an ignition source.

\(a\) *Drop test requirements.* Each tank, or the most critical tank, must be drop-tested as follows:

\(1\) The drop height must be at least 50 feet.

\(2\) The drop impact surface must be nondeforming.

\(3\) The tank must be filled with water to 80 percent of the normal, full capacity.

\(4\) The tank must be enclosed in a surrounding structure representative of the installation unless it can be established that the surrounding structure is free of projections or other design features likely to contribute to rupture of the tank.

\(5\) The tank must drop freely and impact in a horizontal position ±10°.

\(6\) After the drop test, there must be no leakage.

\(b\) *Fuel tank load factors.* Except for fuel tanks located so that tank rupture with fuel release to either significant ignition sources, such as engines, heaters, and auxiliary power units, or occupants is extremely remote, each fuel tank must be designed and installed to retain its contents under the following ultimate inertial load factors, acting alone.

\(1\) For fuel tanks in the cabin:

\(i\) Upward—4g.

\(ii\) Forward—16g.

\(iii\) Sideward—8g.

\(iv\) Downward—20g.

\(2\) For fuel tanks located above or behind the crew or passenger compartment that, if loosened, could injure an occupant in an emergency landing:

\(i\) Upward—1.5g.

\(ii\) Forward—8g.

\(iii\) Sideward—2g.

\(iv\) Downward—4g.

\(3\) For fuel tanks in other areas:

\(i\) Upward—1.5g.

\(ii\) Forward—4g.

\(iii\) Sideward—2g.

\(iv\) Downward—4g.

\(c\) *Fuel line self-sealing breakaway couplings.* Self-sealing breakaway couplings must be installed unless hazardous relative motion of fuel system components to each other or to local rotorcraft structure is demonstrated to be extremely improbable or unless other means are provided. The couplings or equivalent devices must be installed at all fuel tank-to-fuel line connections, tank-to-tank interconnects, and at other points in the fuel system where local structural deformation could lead to the release of fuel.

\(1\) The design and construction of self-sealing breakaway couplings must incorporate the following design features:

\(i\) The load necessary to separate a breakaway coupling must be between 25 to 50 percent of the minimum ultimate failure load (ultimate strength) of the weakest component in the fluid-carrying line. The separation load must in no case be less than 300 pounds, regardless of the size of the fluid line.

\(ii\) A breakaway coupling must separate whenever its ultimate load (as defined in paragraph (c)(1)(i) of this section) is applied in the failure modes most likely to occur.

\(iii\) All breakaway couplings must incorporate design provisions to visually ascertain that the coupling is locked together (leak-free) and is open during normal installation and service.

\(iv\) All breakaway couplings must incorporate design provisions to prevent uncoupling or unintended closing due to operational shocks, vibrations, or accelerations.

\(v\) No breakaway coupling design may allow the release of fuel once the coupling has performed its intended function.

\(2\) All individual breakaway couplings, coupling fuel feed systems, or equivalent means must be designed, tested, installed, and maintained so that inadvertent fuel shutoff in flight is improbable in accordance with [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0027 Airworthiness standards  normal category rotorcraft.md#§27.955   Fuel flow.|§27.955]](a) and must comply with the fatigue evaluation requirements of [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0027 Airworthiness standards  normal category rotorcraft.md#§27.571   Fatigue evaluation of flight structure.|§27.571]] without leaking.

\(3\) Alternate, equivalent means to the use of breakaway couplings must not create a survivable impact-induced load on the fuel line to which it is installed greater than 25 to 50 percent of the ultimate load (strength) of the weakest component in the line and must comply with the fatigue requirements of [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0027 Airworthiness standards  normal category rotorcraft.md#§27.571   Fatigue evaluation of flight structure.|§27.571]] without leaking.

\(d\) *Frangible or deformable structural attachments.* Unless hazardous relative motion of fuel tanks and fuel system components to local rotorcraft structure is demonstrated to be extremely improbable in an otherwise survivable impact, frangible or locally deformable attachments of fuel tanks and fuel system components to local rotorcraft structure must be used. The attachment of fuel tanks and fuel system components to local rotorcraft structure, whether frangible or locally deformable, must be designed such that its separation or relative local deformation will occur without rupture or local tear-out of the fuel tank or fuel system components that will cause fuel leakage. The ultimate strength of frangible or deformable attachments must be as follows:

\(1\) The load required to separate a frangible attachment from its support structure, or deform a locally deformable attachment relative to its support structure, must be between 25 and 50 percent of the minimum ultimate load (ultimate strength) of the weakest component in the attached system.

### §27.1045   Cooling test procedures.

\(a\) *General.* For each stage of flight, the cooling tests must be conducted with the rotorcraft—

\(1\) In the configuration most critical for cooling; and

\(2\) Under the conditions most critical for cooling.

\(b\) *Temperature stabilization.* For the purpose of the cooling tests, a temperature is “stabilized” when its rate of change is less than two degrees F. per minute. The following component and engine fluid temperature stabilization rules apply:

\(1\) For each rotorcraft, and for each stage of flight—

\(i\) The temperatures must be stabilized under the conditions from which entry is made into the stage of flight being investigated; or

\(ii\) If the entry condition normally does not allow temperatures to stabilize, operation through the full entry condition must be conducted before entry into the stage of flight being investigated in order to allow the temperatures to attain their natural levels at the time of entry.

\(2\) For each helicopter during the takeoff stage of flight, the climb at takeoff power must be preceded by a period of hover during which the temperatures are stabilized.

\(c\) *Duration of test.* For each stage of flight the tests must be continued until—

\(1\) The temperatures stabilize or 5 minutes after the occurrence of the highest temperature recorded, as appropriate to the test condition;

\(2\) That stage of flight is completed; or

\(3\) An operating limitation is reached.

### Appendix B to Part 27—Airworthiness Criteria for Helicopter Instrument Flight

I. *General.* A normal category helicopter may not be type certificated for operation under the instrument flight rules (IFR) of this chapter unless it meets the design and installation requirements contained in this appendix.

II\. *Definitions.* (a) VYI means instrument climb speed, utilized instead of VY for compliance with the climb requirements for instrument flight.

\(b\) VNEI means instrument flight never exceed speed, utilized instead of VNE for compliance with maximum limit speed requirements for instrument flight.

\(c\) VMINI means instrument flight minimum speed, utilized in complying with minimum limit speed requirements for instrument flight.

III\. *Trim.* It must be possible to trim the cyclic, collective, and directional control forces to zero at all approved IFR airspeeds, power settings, and configurations appropriate to the type.

IV\. *Static longitudinal stability.* (a) *General.* The helicopter must possess positive static longitudinal control force stability at critical combinations of weight and center of gravity at the conditions specified in paragraph IV (b) or (c) of this appendix, as appropriate. The stick force must vary with speed so that any substantial speed change results in a stick force clearly perceptible to the pilot. For single-pilot approval, the airspeed must return to within 10 percent of the trim speed when the control force is slowly released for each trim condition specified in paragraph IV(b) of the this appendix.

\(b\) *For single-pilot approval:*

\(1\) *Climb.* Stability must be shown in climb throughout the speed range 20 knots either side of trim with—

\(i\) The helicopter trimmed at VYI;

\(ii\) Landing gear retracted (if retractable); and

\(iii\) Power required for limit climb rate (at least 1,000 fpm) at VYI or maximum continuous power, whichever is less.

\(2\) *Cruise.* Stability must be shown throughout the speed range from 0.7 to 1.1 VH or VNEI, whichever is lower, not to exceed ±20 knots from trim with—

\(i\) The helicopter trimmed and power adjusted for level flight at 0.9 VH or 0.9 VNEI, whichever is lower; and

\(ii\) Landing gear retracted (if retractable).

\(3\) *Slow cruise.* Stability must be shown throughout the speed range from 0.9 VMINI to 1.3 VMINI or 20 knots above trim speed, whichever is greater, with—

\(i\) the helicopter trimmed and power adjusted for level flight at 1.1 VMINI; and

\(ii\) Landing gear retracted (if retractable).

\(4\) *Descent.* Stability must be shown throughout the speed range 20 knots either side of trim with—

\(i\) The helicopter trimmed at 0.8 VH or 0.8 VNEI (or 0.8 VLE for the landing gear extended case), whichever is lower;

\(ii\) Power required for 1,000 fpm descent at trim speed; and

\(iii\) Landing gear extended and retracted, if applicable.

\(5\) *Approach.* Stability must be shown throughout the speed range from 0.7 times the minimum recommended approach speed to 20 knots above the maximum recommended approach speed with—

\(i\) The helicopter trimmed at the recommended approach speed or speeds;

\(ii\) Landing gear extended and retracted, if applicable; and

\(iii\) Power required to maintain a 3° glide path and power required to maintain the steepest approach gradient for which approval is requested.

\(c\) Helicopters approved for a minimum crew of two pilots must comply with the provisions of paragraphs IV(b)(2) and IV(b)(5) of this appendix.

V. *Static Lateral Directional Stability.* (a) Static directional stability must be positive throughout the approved ranges of airspeed, power, and vertical speed. In straight and steady sideslips up to ±10° from trim, directional control position must increase without discontinuity with the angle of sideslip, except for a small range of sideslip angles around trim. At greater angles up to the maximum sideslip angle appropriate to the type, increased directional control position must produce an increased angle of sideslip. It must be possible to maintain balanced flight without exceptional pilot skill or alertness.

\(b\) During sideslips up to ±10° from trim throughout the approved ranges of airspeed, power, and vertical speed, there must be no negative dihedral stability perceptible to the pilot through lateral control motion or force. Longitudinal cyclic movement with sideslip must not be excessive.

VI\. *Dynamic stability.* (a) For single-pilot approval—

\(1\) Any oscillation having a period of less than 5 seconds must damp to 1⁄2 amplitude in not more than one cycle.

\(2\) Any oscillation having a period of 5 seconds or more but less than 10 seconds must damp to 1⁄2 amplitude in not more than two cycles.

\(3\) Any oscillation having a period of 10 seconds or more but less than 20 seconds must be damped.

\(4\) Any oscillation having a period of 20 seconds or more may not achieve double amplitude in less than 20 seconds.

\(5\) Any aperiodic response may not achieve double amplitude in less than 6 seconds.

\(b\) For helicopters approved with a minimum crew of two pilots—

\(1\) Any oscillation having a period of less than 5 seconds must damp to 1⁄2 amplitude in not more than two cycles.

\(2\) Any oscillation having a period of 5 seconds or more but less than 10 seconds must be damped.

\(3\) Any oscillation having a period of 10 seconds or more may not achieve double amplitude in less than 10 seconds.

VII\. *Stability Augmentation System (SAS).*

\(a\) If a SAS is used, the reliability of the SAS must be related to the effects of its failure. Any SAS failure condition that would prevent continued safe flight and landing must be extremely improbable. It must be shown that, for any failure condition of the SAS that is not shown to be extremely improbable—

\(1\) The helicopter is safely controllable when the failure or malfunction occurs at any speed or altitude within the approved IFR operating limitations; and

\(2\) The overall flight characteristics of the helicopter allow for prolonged instrument flight without undue pilot effort. Additional unrelated probable failures affecting the control system must be considered. In addition—

\(i\) The controllability and maneuverability requirements in Subpart B of this part must be met throughout a practical flight envelope;

\(ii\) The flight control, trim, and dynamic stability characteristics must not be impaired below a level needed to allow continued safe flight and landing; and

\(iii\) The static longitudinal and static directional stability requirements of Subpart B must be met throughout a practical flight envelope.

\(b\) The SAS must be designed so that it cannot create a hazardous deviation in flight path or produce hazardous loads on the helicopter during normal operation or in the event of malfunction or failure, assuming corrective action begins within an appropriate period of time. Where multiple systems are installed, subsequent malfunction conditions must be considered in sequence unless their occurrence is shown to be improbable.

VIII\. *Equipment, systems, and installation.* The basic equipment and installation must comply with §[[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft.md#§29.1303   Flight and navigation instruments.|§29.1303]], 29.1431, and 29.1433 through Amendment 29-14, with the following exceptions and additions:

\(a\) *Flight and Navigation Instruments.* (1) A magnetic gyro-stablized direction indicator instead of a gyroscopic direction indicator required by [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft.md#§29.1303   Flight and navigation instruments.|§29.1303]](h); and

\(2\) A standby attitude indicator which meets the requirements of §[[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft.md#§29.1303   Flight and navigation instruments.|§29.1303]](g)(1) through (7) instead of a rate-of-turn indicator required by [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft.md#§29.1303   Flight and navigation instruments.|§29.1303]](g). For two-pilot configurations, one pilot's primary indicator may be designated for this purpose. If standby batteries are provided, they may be charged from the aircraft electrical system if adequate isolation is incorporated.

\(b\) *Miscellaneous requirements.* (1) Instrument systems and other systems essential for IFR flight that could be adversely affected by icing must be adequately protected when exposed to the continuous and intermittent maximum icing conditions defined in appendix C of [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0029 Airworthiness standards  transport category rotorcraft.md|Part 29 of this chapter]], whether or not the rotorcraft is certificated for operation in icing conditions.

\(2\) There must be means in the generating system to automatically de-energize and disconnect from the main bus any power source developing hazardous overvoltage.

\(3\) Each required flight instrument using a power supply (electric, vacuum, etc.) must have a visual means integral with the instrument to indicate the adequacy of the power being supplied.

\(4\) When multiple systems performing like functions are required, each system must be grouped, routed, and spaced so that physical separation between systems is provided to ensure that a single malfunction will not adversely affect more than one system.

\(5\) For systems that operate the required flight instruments at each pilot's station—

\(i\) Only the required flight instruments for the first pilot may be connected to that operating system;

\(ii\) Additional instruments, systems, or equipment may not be connected to an operating system for a second pilot unless provisions are made to ensure the continued normal functioning of the required instruments in the event of any malfunction of the additional instruments, systems, or equipment which is not shown to be extremely improbable;

\(iii\) The equipment, systems, and installations must be designed so that one display of the information essential to the safety of flight which is provided by the instruments will remain available to a pilot, without additional crewmember action, after any single failure or combination of failures that is not shown to be extremely improbable; and

\(iv\) For single-pilot configurations, instruments which require a static source must be provided with a means of selecting an alternate source and that source must be calibrated.

IX\. *Rotorcraft Flight Manual.* A Rotorcraft Flight Manual or Rotorcraft Flight Manual IFR Supplement must be provided and must contain—

\(a\) *Limitations.* The approved IFR flight envelope, the IFR flightcrew composition, the revised kinds of operation, and the steepest IFR precision approach gradient for which the helicopter is approved;

\(b\) *Procedures.* Required information for proper operation of IFR systems and the recommended procedures in the event of stability augmentation or electrical system failures; and

\(c\) *Performance.* If VYI differs from VY, climb performance at VYI and with maximum continuous power throughout the ranges of weight, altitude, and temperature for which approval is requested.

X. Electrical and electronic system lightning protection. For regulations concerning lightning protection for electrical and electronic systems, see [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0027 Airworthiness standards  normal category rotorcraft.md#§27.1316   Electrical and electronic system lightning protection.|§27.1316]].

\(d\) *Equipment HIRF Test Level 1.* (1) From 10 kilohertz (kHz) to 400 megahertz (MHz), use conducted susceptibility tests with continuous wave (CW) and 1 kHz square wave modulation with 90 percent depth or greater. The conducted susceptibility current must start at a minimum of 0.6 milliamperes (mA) at 10 kHz, increasing 20 decibels (dB) per frequency decade to a minimum of 30 mA at 500 kHz.

\(2\) From 500 kHz to 40 MHz, the conducted susceptibility current must be at least 30 mA.

\(3\) From 40 MHz to 400 MHz, use conducted susceptibility tests, starting at a minimum of 30 mA at 40 MHz, decreasing 20 dB per frequency decade to a minimum of 3 mA at 400 MHz.

\(4\) From 100 MHz to 400 MHz, use radiated susceptibility tests at a minimum of 20 volts per meter (V/m) peak with CW and 1 kHz square wave modulation with 90 percent depth or greater.

\(5\) From 400 MHz to 8 gigahertz (GHz), use radiated susceptibility tests at a minimum of 150 V/m peak with pulse modulation of 4 percent duty cycle with a 1 kHz pulse repetition frequency. This signal must be switched on and off at a rate of 1 Hz with a duty cycle of 50 percent.

\(e\) *Equipment HIRF Test Level 2.* Equipment HIRF test level 2 is HIRF environment II in table II of this appendix reduced by acceptable aircraft transfer function and attenuation curves. Testing must cover the frequency band of 10 kHz to 8 GHz.

\(f\) *Equipment HIRF Test Level 3.* (1) From 10 kHz to 400 MHz, use conducted susceptibility tests, starting at a minimum of 0.15 mA at 10 kHz, increasing 20 dB per frequency decade to a minimum of 7.5 mA at 500 kHz.

\(2\) From 500 kHz to 40 MHz, use conducted susceptibility tests at a minimum of 7.5 mA.

\(3\) From 40 MHz to 400 MHz, use conducted susceptibility tests, starting at a minimum of 7.5 mA at 40 MHz, decreasing 20 dB per frequency decade to a minimum of 0.75 mA at 400 MHz.

\(4\) From 100 MHz to 8 GHz, use radiated susceptibility tests at a minimum of 5 V/m.
