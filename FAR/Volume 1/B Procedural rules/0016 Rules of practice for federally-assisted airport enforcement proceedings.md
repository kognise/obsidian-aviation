Unless the date is shown to be inaccurate, documents filed with the FAA shall be deemed to be filed on the date of personal delivery, on the mailing date shown on the certificate of service, on the date shown on the postmark if there is no certificate of service, on the send date shown on the facsimile (provided filing has been confirmed through one of the foregoing methods), or on the mailing date shown by other evidence if there is no certificate of service and no postmark. Unless the date is shown to be inaccurate, documents filed electronically shall be deemed to be filed on the date shown on the certificate of service or, if none, the date of electronic transmission to the last party required to be served.

\(c\) *Number of copies.* With the exception of electronic filing or unless otherwise specified, an executed original and three copies of each document shall be filed with the FAA Part 16 Docket Clerk. One of the three copies shall not be stapled, bound or hole-punched. Copies need not be signed, but the name of the person signing the original shall be shown. If a hearing order has been issued in the case, one of the three copies shall be filed with the hearing officer unless otherwise prescribed by the hearing officer.

\(d\) *Form.* Documents filed under this part shall:

\(1\) Be typewritten or legibly printed;

\(2\) Include, in the case of docketed proceedings, the docket number of the proceeding on the front page; and

\(1\) Consistent with this part;

\(2\) Warranted by existing law or that a good faith argument exists for extension, modification, or reversal of existing law; and

\(3\) Not interposed for any improper purpose, such as to harass or to cause unnecessary delay or needless increase in the cost of the administrative process.

\(f\) *Designation of person to receive service.* The initial document filed by any person shall state on the first page the name, physical address, telephone number, facsimile number, if any, and email address, if filing electronically, of the person(s) to be served with documents in the proceeding. If any of these items change during the proceeding, the person shall promptly file notice of the change with the FAA Part 16 Docket Clerk and the hearing officer and shall serve the notice on all parties.

\(4\) By filing a pleading or document electronically as described in this section, a party waives the rights under this part for service by the opposing party and the FAA by methods other than email. If a party subsequently decides to “opt-out” of electronic filing, that party must so notify the FAA Part 16 Docket Clerk and the other party in writing, from which time the FAA and the parties will begin serving the opting-out party in accordance with §[[Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0016 Rules of practice for federally-assisted airport enforcement proceedings.md#§16.13   Filing of documents.|§16.13]] and 16.15.

\(b\) The investigation may include one or more of the following, at the sole discretion of the FAA:

\(1\) A review of the written submissions or pleadings of the parties, as supplemented by any informal investigation the FAA considers necessary and by additional information furnished by the parties at FAA request. In rendering its initial determination, the FAA may rely entirely on the complaint and the responsive pleadings provided under this subpart. Each party shall file documents that it considers sufficient to present all relevant facts and argument necessary for the FAA to determine whether the sponsor is in compliance.

\(2\) Obtaining additional oral and documentary evidence by use of the agency's authority to compel production of such evidence under 49 U.S.C. 40113 and 46104, and 49 U.S.C. 47122.

(b)(1) The Director's Determination shall include findings of fact and conclusions of law, accompanied by explanations and based upon all material issues of fact, credibility of the evidence, law and discretion presented on the record, together with a statement of the reasons therefor.

\(2\) The Director shall issue a determination or rule in a party's favor only if the determination or ruling is in accordance with law and supported by a preponderance of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence contained in the record.

\(c\) A party adversely affected by the Director's Determination may appeal the initial determination as provided in [[Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0016 Rules of practice for federally-assisted airport enforcement proceedings.md#§16.33   Final decisions without hearing.|§16.33]]. However, if the Director's Determination that is appealed contains a Corrective Action Plan, the Director has the discretion to suspend the Corrective Action Plan until the appeal is resolved.

\(d\) If the Director's Determination finds the respondent in noncompliance and proposes the issuance of a compliance order, the initial determination will include notice of opportunity for a hearing under subpart F of this part if a hearing is required by statute or otherwise provided by the FAA. A hearing may be required by statute if the FAA determination would terminate eligibility for grants under 49 U.S.C. 47114(c) or (e), or terminate payments on a grant agreement under 49 U.S.C. subchapter 471. The respondent may elect or waive a hearing, as provided in subpart E of this part.

\(e\) The Director will not consider requests for rehearing, reargument, reconsideration, or modification of a Director's Determination without a finding of good cause.

### §16.33   Final decisions without hearing.

\(a\) The Associate Administrator may transfer to the FAA Assistant Administrator for Civil Rights the responsibility to prepare and issue Final Agency Decisions pursuant to this section for appeals with issues concerning civil rights.

\(b\) The Associate Administrator will issue a final decision on appeal from the Director's Determination, without a hearing, where—

\(1\) The complaint is dismissed after investigation;

\(2\) A hearing is not required by statute and is not otherwise made available by the FAA; or

\(3\) The FAA provides opportunity for a hearing to the respondent and the respondent waives the opportunity for a hearing as provided in subpart E of this part.

\(c\) In the cases described in paragraph (b) of this section, within 30 days after the date of service of the initial determination, a party adversely affected by the Director's Determination may file in accordance with [[Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0016 Rules of practice for federally-assisted airport enforcement proceedings.md#§16.13   Filing of documents.|§16.13]] and serve in accordance with [[Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0016 Rules of practice for federally-assisted airport enforcement proceedings.md#§16.15   Service of documents on the parties and the agency.|§16.15]] a simultaneous Notice of Appeal and Brief.

\(d\) A reply to an appeal brief may be filed within 20 days after the date of service of the appeal.

\(e\) On appeal, the Associate Administrator will consider the issues addressed in any order on a motion to dismiss or motion for summary judgment and any issues accepted in the Director's Determination using the following analysis:

\(1\) Are the findings of fact each supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative, and substantial evidence contained in the record?

\(2\) Are conclusions made in accordance with law, precedent and policy?

\(3\) Are the questions on appeal substantial?

\(4\) Have any prejudicial errors occurred?

\(f\) Any new issues or evidence presented in an appeal or reply will not be considered unless accompanied by a petition and good cause found as to why the new issue or evidence was not presented to the Director. Such a petition must:

\(1\) Set forth the new matter;

\(2\) Contain affidavits of prospective witnesses, authenticated documents, or both, or an explanation of why such substantiation is unavailable; and

\(3\) Contain a statement explaining why such new issue or evidence could not have been discovered in the exercise of due diligence prior to the date on which the evidentiary record closed.

\(g\) The Associate Administrator will issue a final decision and order within 60 days after the due date of the reply.

\(h\) If no appeal is filed within the time period specified in paragraph (c) of this section, the Director's Determination becomes the final decision and order of the FAA without further action. A Director's Determination that becomes final, because there is no administrative appeal, is not judicially reviewable.

\(i\) No requests for rehearing, reargument, reconsideration, or modification of a final order will be considered without a finding of good cause.

\[Amdt. 16-1, 78 FR 56145, Sept. 12, 2013\]

### §16.34   Consent orders.

\(a\) The parties may agree at any time before the issuance of a final agency decision to dispose of the case by proposing a consent order. Good faith efforts to resolve a complaint through issuance of a consent order may continue throughout the administrative process. However, except as provided in [[Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0016 Rules of practice for federally-assisted airport enforcement proceedings.md#§16.11   General processes.|§16.11]](a), such efforts may not serve as the basis for extensions of the times set forth in this part.

\(b\) A proposal for a consent order, specified in paragraph (a) of this section, shall include:

\(1\) A proposed consent order;

\(2\) An admission of all jurisdictional facts; and

\(3\) An express waiver of the right to further procedural steps and of all rights of judicial review.

\(c\) If the parties agree to dispose of a case by issuance of a consent order before the FAA issues a Director's Determination, the proposal for a consent order is submitted jointly by the parties to the Director, together with a request to adopt the consent order and dismiss the case. The Director may issue the consent order as an order of the FAA and terminate the proceeding.

In any other hearing, an extension of time granted by the hearing officer for any reason extends the due date for the hearing officer's initial decision and for the final agency decision by the length of time of the hearing officer's decision.

\(a\) *Request for subpoena.* A party may apply to the hearing officer, within the time specified for such applications in the prehearing conference report, for a subpoena to compel testimony at a hearing or to require the production of documents only from the following persons:

\(1\) Another party;

\(2\) An officer, employee, or agent of another party;

\(3\) Any other person named in the complaint as participating in or benefiting from the actions of the respondent alleged to have violated any Act;

\(4\) An officer, employee, or agent of any other person named in the complaint as participating in or benefiting from the actions of the respondent alleged to have violated any Act.

\(b\) *Issuance and service of subpoena.* (1) The hearing officer issues the subpoena if the hearing officer determines that the evidence to be obtained by the subpoena is relevant and material to the resolution of the issues in the case.

\(2\) Subpoenas shall be served by personal service, or upon an agent designated in writing for the purpose, or by certified mail, return receipt addressed to such person or agent. Whenever service is made by registered or certified mail, the date of mailing shall be considered as the time when service is made.

\(3\) A subpoena issued under this part is effective throughout the United States or any territory or possession thereof.

\(c\) *Motions to quash or modify subpoena.* (1) A party or any person upon whom a subpoena has been served may file a motion to quash or modify the subpoena with the hearing officer at or before the time specified in the subpoena for the filing of such motions. The applicant shall describe in detail the basis for the application to quash or modify the subpoena including, but not limited to, a statement that the testimony, document, or tangible evidence is not relevant to the proceeding, that the subpoena is not reasonably tailored to the scope of the proceeding, or that the subpoena is unreasonable and oppressive.

\(2\) A motion to quash or modify the subpoena stays the effect of the subpoena pending a decision by the hearing officer on the motion.

### §16.221   Witness fees.

\(a\) The party on whose behalf a witness appears is responsible for paying any witness fees and mileage expenses.

\(b\) Except for employees of the United States summoned to testify as to matters related to their public employment, witnesses summoned by subpoena shall be paid the same fees and mileage expenses as are paid to a witness in a court of the United States in comparable circumstances.

### §16.223   Evidence.

\(a\) *General.* A party may submit direct and rebuttal evidence in accordance with this section.

\(b\) *Requirement for written testimony and evidence.* Except in the case of evidence obtained by subpoena, or in the case of a special ruling by the hearing officer to admit oral testimony, a party's direct and rebuttal evidence shall be submitted in written form in advance of the oral hearing pursuant to the schedule established in the hearing officer's prehearing conference report. Written direct and rebuttal fact testimony shall be certified by the witness as true and correct. Subject to the same exception (for evidence obtained by subpoena or subject to a special ruling by the hearing officer), oral examination of a party's own witness is limited to certification of the accuracy of written evidence, including correction and updating, if necessary, and reexamination following cross-examination by other parties.

\(c\) *Subpoenaed testimony.* Testimony of witnesses appearing under subpoena may be obtained orally.

\(d\) *Cross-examination.* A party may conduct cross-examination that may be required for disclosure of the facts, subject to control by the hearing officer for fairness, expedition and exclusion of extraneous matters.

\(e\) *Hearsay evidence.* Hearsay evidence is admissible in proceedings governed by this part. The fact that evidence is hearsay goes to the weight of evidence and does not affect its admissibility.

\(f\) *Admission of evidence.* The hearing officer admits evidence introduced by a party in support of its case in accordance with this section, but may exclude irrelevant, immaterial, or unduly repetitious evidence.

\(g\) *Expert or opinion witnesses.* An employee of the FAA or DOT may not be called as an expert or opinion witness for any party other than the agency except as provided in Department of Transportation regulations at 49 CFR part 9.

### §16.225   Public disclosure of evidence.

\(a\) Except as provided in this section, the hearing shall be open to the public.

\(b\) The hearing officer may order that any information contained in the record be withheld from public disclosure. Any person may object to disclosure of information in the record by filing a written motion to withhold specific information with the hearing officer. The person shall state specific grounds for nondisclosure in the motion.

\(c\) The hearing officer shall grant the motion to withhold information from public disclosure if the hearing officer determines that disclosure would be in violation of the Privacy Act, would reveal trade secrets or privileged or confidential commercial or financial information, or is otherwise prohibited by law.

### §16.227   Standard of proof.

The hearing officer shall issue an initial decision or rule in a party's favor only if the decision or ruling is in accordance with law and supported by a preponderance of the reliable, probative, and substantial evidence contained in the record.

\[Amdt. 16-1, as amended at 78 FR 56147, Sept. 12, 2013\]

### §16.229   Burden of proof.

As used in this subpart, the burden of proof is as follows:

\(a\) The burden of proof of noncompliance with an Act or any regulation, order, agreement or document of conveyance issued under the authority of an Act is on the agency.

\(b\) Except as otherwise provided by statute or rule, the proponent of a motion, request, or order has the burden of proof.

\(c\) A party who has asserted an affirmative defense has the burden of proving the affirmative defense.

\[Doc. No. 27783, 61 FR 54004, Oct. 16, 1996, as amended at Amdt. 16-1, 78 FR 56147, Sept. 12, 2013\]

### §16.231   Offer of proof.

A party whose evidence has been excluded by a ruling of the hearing officer may offer the evidence on the record when filing an appeal.

### §16.233   Record.

\(a\) *Exclusive record.* The transcript of all testimony in the hearing, all exhibits received into evidence, all motions, applications requests and rulings, all documents included in the hearing record and the Director's Determination shall constitute the exclusive record for decision in the proceedings and the basis for the issuance of any orders.

\(b\) *Examination and copy of record.* A copy of the record will be filed by the FAA Part 16 Docket Clerk in the Federal Docket Management System (FDMS). Any person desiring to review the record may then do so at *http://www.regulations.gov.*

\[Amdt. 16-1, 78 FR 56147, Sept. 12, 2013\]

### §16.235   Argument before the hearing officer.

\(a\) *Argument during the hearing.* During the hearing, the hearing officer shall give the parties reasonable opportunity to present oral argument on the record supporting or opposing motions, objections, and rulings if the parties request an opportunity for argument. The hearing officer may direct written argument during the hearing if the hearing officer finds that submission of written arguments would not delay the hearing.

\(b\) *Posthearing briefs.* The hearing officer may request or permit the parties to submit posthearing briefs. The hearing officer may provide for the filing of simultaneous reply briefs as well, if such filing will not unduly delay the issuance of the hearing officer's initial decision. Posthearing briefs shall include proposed findings of fact and conclusions of law; exceptions to rulings of the hearing officer; references to the record in support of the findings of fact; and supporting arguments for the proposed findings, proposed conclusions, and exceptions.

\[Doc. No. 27783, 61 FR 54004, Oct. 16, 1996, as amended at Amdt. 16-1, 78 FR 56147, Sept. 12, 2013\]

### §16.237   Waiver of procedures.

\(a\) The hearing officer shall waive such procedural steps as all parties to the hearing agree to waive before issuance of an initial decision.

\(b\) Consent to a waiver of any procedural step bars the raising of this issue on appeal.

\(c\) The parties may not by consent waive the obligation of the hearing officer to enter an initial decision on the record.

### §16.241   Initial decisions, order, and appeals.

\(a\) The hearing officer shall issue an initial decision based on the record developed during the proceeding and shall send the initial decision to the parties not later than 110 days after the Director's Determination unless otherwise provided in the hearing order.

\(b\) Each party adversely affected by the hearing officer's initial decision may file an appeal with the Associate Administrator within 15 days of the date the initial decision is issued. Each party may file a reply to an appeal within 10 days after it is served on the party. Filing and service of appeals and replies shall be by personal delivery.

\(c\) If an appeal is filed, the Associate Administrator reviews the entire record and issues a final agency decision and order within 60 days of the due date of the reply. If no appeal is filed, the Associate Administrator may take review of the case on his or her own motion. If the Associate Administrator finds that the respondent is not in compliance with any Act or any regulation, agreement, or document of conveyance issued or made under such Act, the final agency order includes, in accordance with [[Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0016 Rules of practice for federally-assisted airport enforcement proceedings.md#§16.245   Associate Administrator review after a hearing.|§16.245]](d), a statement of corrective action, if appropriate, and identifies sanctions for continued noncompliance.

\(d\) If no appeal is filed, and the Associate Administrator does not take review of the initial decision on the Associate Administrator's own motion, the initial decision shall take effect as the final agency decision and order on the sixteenth day after the actual date the initial decision is issued.

\(e\) The failure to file an appeal is deemed a waiver of any rights to seek judicial review of an initial decision that becomes a final agency decision by operation of paragraph (d) of this section.

\[Doc. No. 27783, 61 FR 54004, Oct. 16, 1996, as amended at Amdt. 16-1, 78 FR 56147, Sept. 12, 2013\]

### §16.243   Consent orders.

\(a\) The agency attorney and the respondents may agree at any time before the issuance of a final decision and order to dispose of the case by issuance of a consent order. Good faith efforts to resolve a complaint through issuance of a consent order may continue throughout the administrative process. Except as provided in [[Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0016 Rules of practice for federally-assisted airport enforcement proceedings.md#§16.209   Extension of time.|§16.209]], such efforts may not serve as the basis for extensions of the times set forth in this part.

\(b\) A proposal for a consent order, specified in paragraph (a) of this section, shall include:

\(1\) A proposed consent order;

\(2\) An admission of all jurisdictional facts;

\(3\) An express waiver of the right to further procedural steps and of all rights of judicial review; and

\(4\) The hearing order, if issued, and an acknowledgment that the hearing order may be used to construe the terms of the consent order.

\(c\) If the issuance of a consent order has been agreed upon by all parties to the hearing, the proposed consent order shall be filed with the hearing officer, along with a draft order adopting the consent decree and dismissing the case, for the hearing officer's adoption.

\(d\) The deadline for the hearing officer's initial decision and the final agency decision is extended by the amount of days elapsed between the filing of the proposed consent order with the hearing officer and the issuance of the hearing officer's order continuing the hearing.

\(e\) If the agency attorney and sponsor agree to dispose of a case by issuance of a consent order before the FAA issues a hearing order, the proposal for a consent order is submitted jointly to the official authorized to issue a hearing order, together with a request to adopt the consent order and dismiss the case. The official authorized to issue the hearing order issues the consent order as an order of the FAA and terminates the proceeding.

\[Doc. No. 27783, 61 FR 54004, Oct. 16, 1996, as amended at Amdt. 16-1, 78 FR 56147, Sept. 12, 2013\]

### §16.245   Associate Administrator review after a hearing.

\(a\) The Associate Administrator may transfer to the FAA Assistant Administrator for Civil Rights the authority to prepare and issue Final Agency Decisions pursuant to [[Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0016 Rules of practice for federally-assisted airport enforcement proceedings.md#§16.241   Initial decisions, order, and appeals.|§16.241]] for appeals from a hearing concerning civil rights issues.

\(b\) After a hearing is held, and, after considering the issues as set forth in [[Volume 1/B Procedural rules/0016 Rules of practice for federally-assisted airport enforcement proceedings.md#§16.245   Associate Administrator review after a hearing.|§16.245]](e), if the Associate Administrator determines that the hearing officer's initial decision or order should be changed, the Associate Administrator may:

\(1\) Make any necessary findings and issue an order in lieu of the hearing officer's initial decision or order, or

\(2\) Remand the proceeding for any such purpose as the Associate Administrator may deem necessary.

\(c\) If the Associate Administrator takes review of the hearing officer's initial decision on the Associate Administrator's own motion, the Associate Administrator will issue a notice of review within 20 days of the actual date the initial decision is issued.

\(1\) The notice sets forth the specific findings of fact and conclusions of law in the initial decision that are subject to review by the Associate Administrator.

\(2\) Parties may file one brief on review to the Associate Administrator or rely on their posthearing brief to the hearing officer. A brief on review shall be filed not later than 10 days after service of the notice of review. Filing and service of a brief on review shall be by personal delivery.

\(3\) The Associate Administrator issues a final agency decision and order within 30 days of the due date of the brief. If the Associate Administrator finds that the respondent is not in compliance with any Act or any regulation, agreement or document of conveyance issued under such Act, the final agency order includes a statement of corrective action, if appropriate.

\(d\) When the final agency decision finds a respondent in noncompliance, and where a respondent fails to properly seek judicial review of the final agency decision as set forth in subpart G of this part, the Associate Administrator will issue an order remanding the case to the Director for the following action:

\(1\) In the event that the respondent fails to submit, in accordance with the final agency decision, a Corrective Action Plan acceptable to the FAA within the time provided, unless extended by the FAA for good cause, and/or if the respondent fails to complete the Corrective Action Plan as specified therein, the Director may initiate action to revoke and/or deny applications for Airport Improvement Program grants issued under 49 U.S.C. 47114(c)-(e) and 47115. When the Director concludes that the respondent has fully complied with the Corrective Action Plan, the Director will issue an Order terminating the proceeding.

\(2\) For those violations that cannot be remedied through corrective action, the Director may initiate action to revoke and/or deny the respondent's applications for Airport Improvement Program grants issued under 49 U.S.C. 47114(c)-(e) and 47115.

\(e\) On appeal from a hearing officer's initial decision, the Associate Administrator will consider the following questions:

\(1\) Are the findings of fact each supported by a preponderance of reliable, probative and substantial evidence?

\(2\) Are conclusions made in accordance with law, precedent and policy?

\(3\) Are the questions on appeal substantial?

\(4\) Have any prejudicial errors occurred?

\(f\) Any new issues or evidence presented in an appeal or reply will not be allowed unless accompanied by a certified petition and good cause found as to why the new matter was not presented to the Director. Such a petition must:

\(1\) Set forth the new issues or evidence;

\(2\) Contain affidavits of prospective witnesses, authenticated documents, or both, or an explanation of why such substantiation is unavailable; and

\(3\) Contain a statement explaining why such new matter could not have been discovered in the exercise of due diligence prior to the date on which the evidentiary record closed.

\(g\) A Final Agency Decision may be appealed in accordance with subpart G of this part.

\[Amdt. 16-1, 78 FR 56147, Sept. 12, 2013\]

\(2\) A Director's Determination;

\(3\) An initial decision issued by a hearing officer at the conclusion of a hearing;
