## Subpart A—General

### §296.1   Purpose.

This part establishes rules for the indirect air transportation of property. It creates a class of air carriers to provide this air transportation and grants exemptions from certain provisions of the Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation).

\[ER-1257, 46 FR 52591, Oct. 27, 1981, as amended at 60 FR 43527, Aug. 22, 1995\]

### §296.2   Applicability.

This part applies to air transportation of property by indirect cargo air carriers, and to persons entering into control relationships with indirect cargo air carriers.

### §296.3   Indirect cargo air carrier.

An indirect cargo air carrier is any U.S. citizen who undertakes to engage indirectly in air transportation of property, and uses for the whole or any part of such transportation the services of an air carrier or a foreign air carrier that directly engages in the operation of aircraft under a certificate, regulation, order, or permit issued by the Department of Transportation or its predecessor to the extent that those actions, by law, are still in effect, or the services of its agent, or of another indirect cargo air carrier.

\[ER-1261, 46 FR 54727, Nov. 4, 1981, as amended by Doc. No. 47939, 57 FR 40103, Sept. 2, 1992; DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15934, Apr. 16, 2019\]

### §296.4   Joint loading.

Nothing in this part shall preclude joint loading, meaning the pooling of shipments and their delivery to a direct air carrier for transportation as one shipment, under an agreement between two or more indirect air carriers or foreign indirect air carriers.

### §296.5   Agency relationships.

An indirect cargo air carrier may act as agent of a shipper, or of a direct air carrier that has authorized such agency, rather than as an air carrier, if it expressly reserves the option to do so when the shipment is accepted.

### §296.6   Public disclosure of cargo liability limits and insurance.

Every indirect cargo air carrier shall give notice in writing to the shipper, when any shipment is accepted, of the existence or absence of cargo liability accident insurance, and of the limits on the extent of its liability, if any. The notice shall be clear and conspicuously included on or attached to all of its rate sheets and airwaybills.

## Subpart B—Exemption for Indirect Air Transportation of Property

### §296.10   Exemption from the Statute.
