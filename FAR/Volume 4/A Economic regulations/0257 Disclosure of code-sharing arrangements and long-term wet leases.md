### §257.1   Purpose.

The purpose of this part is to ensure that ticket agents doing business in the United States, air carriers, and foreign air carriers tell consumers clearly when the air transportation they are buying or considering buying involves a code-sharing arrangement or a long-term wet lease, and that they disclose to consumers the transporting carrier's identity.

### §257.2   Applicability.

This part applies to the following:

\(a\) Direct air carriers and foreign air carriers that participate in code-sharing arrangements or long-term wet leases involving scheduled passenger air transportation; and

\(b\) Ticket agents doing business in the United States that sell scheduled passenger air transportation services involving code-sharing arrangements or long-term wet leases.

### §257.3   Definitions.

As used in this part:

*Air transportation* means foreign air transportation or interstate air transportation as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102 (a)(23) and (25) respectively.

*Carrier* means any air carrier or foreign air carrier as defined in 49 U.S.C. 40102(2) or 49 U.S.C. 40102(21), respectively, that is engaged directly in scheduled passenger air transportation, including by wet lease.

*Code-sharing arrangement* means an arrangement whereby a carrier's designator code is used to identify a flight operated by another carrier.

*Designator code* means the airline designations originally allotted, administered, and prescribed by the Department of Transportation (DOT), by operation of law, pursuant to 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII or its predecessor's statutory provisions still in effect by law.

*Long-term wet lease* means a lease by which the lessor provides both an aircraft and crew dedicated to a particular route(s), and which either:

\(1\) Lasts more than 60 days; or

\(2\) Is part of a series of such leases that amounts to a continuing arrangement lasting more than 60 days.

*Operating carrier* means the carrier that is operating the aircraft in a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease.

*Ticket agent* has the meaning ascribed to it in 49 U.S.C. 40102(45).

### §257.4   Unfair and deceptive practice.

The holding out or sale of scheduled passenger air transportation involving a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease is prohibited as unfair and deceptive in violation of 49 U.S.C. 41712 unless, in conjunction with such holding out or sale, carriers and ticket agents follow the requirements of this part.

### §257.5   Notice requirement.

\(a\) *Notice in flight itineraries and schedules.* Each air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent providing flight itineraries and/or schedules for scheduled passenger air transportation to the public in the United States and to the Official Airline Guides and comparable publications, and, where applicable, computer reservation systems, shall ensure that each flight on which the designator code is not that of the operating carrier is clearly and prominently identified and contains the following disclosures. If there is more than one operating carrier for a particular flight (*e.g.,* change of gauge), the required disclosures shall be made for each flight segment where the designator code is not that of the operating carrier.

\(1\) In flight schedule information provided by an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent to U.S. consumers on desktop browser-based Web sites or applications in response to any requested itinerary search, for each flight in scheduled passenger air transportation that is operated by a carrier other than the one listed for that flight, the corporate name of the transporting carrier and any other name under which the service is held out to the public must appear prominently in text format, with font size not smaller than the font size of the flight itinerary itself, on the first display following the input of a search query, immediately adjacent to each code-share flight in that search-results list. Roll-over, pop-up and linked disclosures do not comply with this paragraph.

\(2\) In flight schedule information provided by an air carrier, foreign air carrier, or ticket agent to U.S. consumers on mobile browser-based Web sites or applications in response to any requested itinerary search, for each flight in scheduled passenger air transportation that is operated by a carrier other than the one listed for that flight, the corporate name of the transporting carrier must appear prominently in text format, with font size not smaller than the font size of the flight itinerary itself, on the first display following the input of a search query, immediately adjacent to each code-share flight in that search-results list. Roll-over, pop-up and linked disclosures do not comply with this paragraph.

\(3\) For static written schedules, each flight in scheduled passenger air transportation that is operated by a carrier other than the one listed for that flight shall be identified by an asterisk or other easily identifiable mark that leads to disclosure of the corporate name of the operating carrier and any other name under which that service is held out to the public.

\(4\) Each air carrier and foreign air carrier that provides flight schedule information to any computer reservation system or global distribution system that receives and distributes the U.S. or foreign carrier's fare, schedule, or availability information shall ensure that each flight on which the designator code is not that of the operating carrier is clearly and prominently identified and the corporate name of the transporting carrier and any other name under which the service is held out to the public appears prominently in text format, with font size that is not smaller than the font size of the flight itinerary itself, immediately adjacent to each code-share flight in that search-results list.

\(b\) *Notice in oral communications with prospective consumers.* In any direct oral communication in the United States with a prospective consumer, and in any telephone call placed from the United States by a prospective consumer, concerning a flight within, to, or from the United States that is part of a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease, a ticket agent doing business in the United States or a carrier shall inform the consumer, the first time that such a flight is offered to the consumer, or, if no such offer was made, the first time a consumer inquires about such a flight, that the operating carrier is not the carrier whose name or designator code will appear on the ticket and shall identify the transporting carrier by its corporate name and any other name under which that service is held out to the public.

\(c\) *Notice in ticket confirmations.* At the time of purchase, each selling carrier or ticket agent shall provide written disclosure of the actual operator of the flight to each consumer of scheduled passenger air transportation sold in the United States that involves a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease. For any flight on which the designator code is not that of the operating carrier the notice shall state “Operated by” followed by the corporate name of the transporting carrier and any other name in which that service is held out to the public. The following form of statement will satisfy the requirement of this paragraph:

*Important Notice: Service between XYZ City and ABC City will be operated by Jane Doe Airlines d/b/a QRS Express.* At the purchaser's request, the notice required by this part may be delivered in person, or by fax, electronic mail, or any other reliable method of transmitting written material.

\(d\) In any written advertisement distributed in or mailed to or from the United States (including those that appear on an internet Web site that is marketed to consumers in the United States) for service in a city-pair market that is provided under a code-sharing arrangement or long-term wet lease, the advertisement shall prominently disclose that the advertised service may involve travel on another carrier and clearly indicate the nature of the service in reasonably sized type and shall identify all potential operating carriers involved in the markets being advertised by corporate name and by any other name under which that service is held out to the public. In any radio or television advertisement broadcast in the United States for service in a city-pair market that is provided under a code-sharing or long-term wet lease, the advertisement shall include at least a generic disclosure statement, such as “Some flights are operated by other airlines.”
