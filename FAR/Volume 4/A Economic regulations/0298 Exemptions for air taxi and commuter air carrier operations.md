## Subpart A—General

### §298.1   Applicability of part.

This part establishes classifications of air carriers known as “air taxi operators” and “commuter air carriers,” provides certain exemptions to them from some of the economic regulatory provisions of Subtitle VII of Title 49 of the United States Code (Transportation), specifies procedures by which such air carriers may obtain authority to conduct operations, and establishes rules applicable to their operations in interstate and/or foreign air transportation in all States, Territories and possessions of the United States. This part also establishes reporting requirements for commuter air carriers and small certificated air carriers.

### §298.2   Definitions.

As used in this part:

*Air taxi operator* means an air carrier as established by §298.3(a).

*Air transportation* means interstate air transportation, foreign air transportation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft as defined by the Statute.1

<div>

1Interstate air transportation is defined in section 40102(a)(25) as the transportation of passengers or property by aircraft as a common carrier for compensation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft (1) between a place in (i) a State, territory, or possession of the United States and a place in the District of Columbia or another State, territory, or possession of the United States; (ii) Hawaii and another place in Hawaii through the airspace over a place outside Hawaii; (iii) the District of Columbia and another place in the District of Columbia; or (iv) a territory or possession of the United States and another place in the same territory or possession; and (2) when any part of the transportation is by aircraft. Note: Operations wholly within the geographic limits of a single State are not considered interstate air transportation if in those operations the carrier transports no more than a *de minimis* volume of passengers or property moving as part of a continuous journey to or from a point outside the State.

Foreign air transportation is defined in section 40102(a)(23) of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII as the transportation of passengers or property by aircraft as a common carrier for compensation, or the transportation of mail by aircraft, between a place in the United States and a place outside the United States when any part of the transportation is by aircraft.

Air transportation also is defined to include the transportation of mail by aircraft. Section 5402 of the Postal Reorganization Act, 39 U.S.C. 5402, authorizes the carriage of mail by air taxi operators and commuter air carriers in some circumstances under contract with the U.S. Postal Service.

</div>

### §298.61   Reporting of traffic statistics.

\(a\) Each commuter air carrier and small certificated air carrier shall file Schedule T-100, U.S. Air Carrier Traffic and Capacity Data by Nonstop Segment and On-Flight Market.”

\(b\) Schedule T-100 shall be filed monthly as set forth in§298.60.

\(1\) Schedule T-100 collects summarized flight stage data and on-flight market data from revenue flights. All traffic statistics shall be compiled in terms of each flight stage as actually performed. The detail T-100 data shall be maintained in such a manner as to permit monthly summarization and organization into two basic groupings. The first grouping, the nonstop segment information, is to be summarized by equipment type, within class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard to individual flight number. The second grouping requires that the enplanement/deplanement information be broken out into separate units called on-flight market records, which shall be summarized by class of service, within pair-of-points, without regard for equipment type or flight number.

\(2\) *Joint-service operations.* The Department may authorize joint service operations between two direct air carriers. Examples of these joint-service operations are: blocked-space agreements; part-charter agreements; code-sharing agreements; wet-lease agreements, and similar arrangements.

\(i\) Joint-service operations are reported by the carrier in operational control of the flight, i.e., the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA operating authority. The traffic moving under these agreements is reported on Schedule T-100 the same way as any other traffic on the aircraft.

\(ii\) If there are questions about reporting a joint-service operation, contact the BTS Assistant Director—Airline Information (fax no. 202 366-3383, telephone no. 202 366-4373). Joint-service operations are reported in Schedule T-100 in accordance with this paragraph (b).

\(iii\) *Operational control.* The air carrier in operational control of the aircraft (the carrier that uses its flight crews under its own FAA operating authority) must report joint-service operations.

\(c\) *Service classes.* (1) The statistical classifications are designed to reflect the operating characteristics attributable to each distinctive type of service offered. The combination of scheduled and nonscheduled operations with passenger, all-cargo, and military services are placed into service classes as follows:

<div>

</div>

</div>

\(2\) Scheduled services include traffic and capacity elements applicable to air transportation provided pursuant to published schedules and extra sections of scheduled flights. Scheduled Passenger/Cargo (Service Class F) is a composite of first class, coach, and mixed passenger/cargo service.

\(3\) Nonscheduled services include all traffic and capacity elements applicable to the performance of nonscheduled aircraft charters, and other air transportation services not constituting an integral part of services performed pursuant to published flight schedules.

\(d\) *Air transport traffic and capacity elements.* (1) Within each of the service classifications, carriers shall report air transport traffic and capacity elements. The elements are reported on segment or market records as follows:
