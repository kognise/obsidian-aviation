### §243.1   Purpose.

The purpose of this part is to ensure that the U.S. government has prompt and adequate information in case of an aviation disaster on covered flight segments.

### §243.3   Definitions.

*Air piracy* means any seizure of or exercise of control over an aircraft, by force or violence or threat of force or violence, or by any other form of intimidation, and with wrongful intent.

*Aviation disaster* means:

\(1\) An occurrence associated with the operation of an aircraft that takes place between the time any passengers have boarded the aircraft with the intention of flight and the time all such persons have disembarked or have been removed from the aircraft, and in which any person suffers death or serious injury, and in which the death or injury was caused by a crash, fire, collision, sabotage or accident;

\(2\) A missing aircraft; or

\(3\) An act of air piracy.

*Contact* means a person not on the covered flight or an entity that should be contacted in case of an aviation disaster. The contact need not have any particular relationship to a passenger.

*Covered airline* means:

\(1\) certificated air carriers, and

\(2\) foreign air carriers, except those that hold Department of Transportation authority to conduct operations in foreign air transportation using only small aircraft (*i.e.*, aircraft designed to have a maximum passenger capacity of not more than 60 seats or a maximum payload capacity of not more than 18,000 pounds).

*Covered flight segment* means a passenger-carrying flight segment operating to or from the United States (*i.e.*, the flight segment where the last point of departure or the first point of arrival is in the United States). A covered flight segment does not include a flight segment in which both the point of departure and point of arrival are in the United States.

*Full name* means the given name, middle initial or middle name, if any, and family name or surname as provided by the passenger.

*Passenger* means every person aboard a covered flight segment regardless of whether he or she paid for the transportation, had a reservation, or occupied a seat, except the crew. For the purposes of this part, passenger includes, but is not limited to, a revenue and non-revenue passenger, a person holding a confirmed reservation, a standby or walkup, a person rerouted from another flight or airline, an infant held upon a person's lap and a person occupying a jump seat. Airline personnel who are on board but not working on that particular flight segment would be considered passengers for the purpose of this part.

*United States* means the States comprising the United States of America, the District of Columbia, and the territories and possessions of the United States, including the territorial sea and the overlying airspace.

*U.S. citizen* means United States nationals as defined in 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(22).
