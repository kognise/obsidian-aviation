## Subpart A—General

### §293.1   Applicability.

This part applies to air carriers and foreign air carriers providing scheduled transportation of passengers and their baggage in foreign air transportation.

### §293.2   Definitions.

For purposes of this part the definitions in [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs.md#§221.3   Definitions.|§221.3]] of this chapter apply.

## Subpart B—Exemption From Filing Tariffs

### §293.10   Exemption.

\(a\) Air carriers and foreign air carriers are exempted from the duty to file passenger tariffs with the Department of Transportation, as required by 49 U.S.C. 41504 and [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs.md|14 CFR part 221]], as follows:

\(1\) The Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs will, by notice, issue and periodically update a list establishing the following categories of markets:

\(i\) In Category A markets, carriers are exempted from the duty to file all passenger tariffs unless they are nationals of countries listed in Category C, or are subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.

\(ii\) In Category B markets, carriers are exempted from the duty to file all passenger tariffs except those setting forth one-way economy-class fares and governing provisions thereto, unless they are nationals of countries listed in Category C, or are subject to the provisions of paragraph (c) of this section.

\(iii\) In Category C markets, carriers shall continue to file all passenger tariffs, except as provided in [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0293 International passenger transportation.md#§293.10   Exemption.|§293.10]](b);

\(2\) The Assistant Secretary will list country-pair markets falling in Categories A and C, taking into consideration the factors in paragraphs (a)(2) (i) through (iv) of this section. All country-pair markets not listed in Categories A or C shall be considered to be in Category B and need not be specifically listed.

\(i\) Whether the U.S. has an aviation agreement in force with that country providing double-disapproval treatment of prices filed by the carriers of the Parties;

\(ii\) Whether the country's Government has disapproved or deterred U.S. carrier price leadership or matching tariff filings in any market;

\(iii\) Whether the country's Government has placed significant restrictions on carrier entry or capacity in any market; and

\(iv\) Whether the country's government is honoring the provisions of the bilateral aviation agreement and there are no significant bilateral problems.

\(b\) By notice of the Assistant Secretary, new country-pair markets will be listed in the appropriate category, and existing country-pair markets may be transferred between categories.

\(c\) Notwithstanding a determination that a country is in Category A or B, if the Assistant Secretary finds that effective price leadership opportunities for U.S. carriers are not available between that country and any third country, carriers that are nationals of such country may be required to file tariffs, as provided under part 221 or as otherwise directed in the notice, for some or all of their services between the U.S. and third countries.

\(d\) Air carriers and foreign air carriers are exempted from the duty to file governing rules tariffs containing general conditions of carriage with the Department of Transportation, as required by 49 U.S.C. 41504 and [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs.md|14 CFR part 221]]. A description of the general conditions of carriage will be included in the Assistant Secretary's initial notice.

\(e\) Notwithstanding paragraph (d) of this section, air carriers and foreign air carriers shall file and maintain a tariff with the Department to the extent required by 14 CFR 203.4 and other implementing regulations.

\(f\) Authority for determining what rules are covered by paragraph (d) of this section and for determining the filing format for the tariffs required by paragraph (e) of this section is delegated to the Director of the Office of International Aviation.

### §293.11   Required statement.

Each governing rules tariff shall include the following statements:

\(a\) “Rules herein containing general conditions of carriage are not part of the official U.S. D.O.T. tariff.”

\(b\) “The rules and provisions contained herein apply only to the passenger fares and charges that the U.S. Department of Transportation requires to be filed as tariffs.”

### §293.12   Revocation of exemption.

\(a\) The Department, upon complaint or upon its own initiative, may, immediately and without hearing, revoke, in whole or in part, the exemption granted by this part with respect to a carrier or carriers, when such action is in the public interest.

\(b\) Any such action will be taken in a notice issued by the Assistant Secretary for Aviation and International Affairs, and will identify the tariff matter to be filed, and the deadline for carrier compliance.

\(c\) Revocations under this section will have the effect of reinstating all applicable tariff requirements and procedures specified in the Department's Regulations for the tariff material to be filed, unless otherwise specified by the Department.

## Subpart C—Effect of Exemption

### §293.20   Rule of construction.

To the extent that a carrier holds an effective exemption from the duty to file tariffs under this part, it shall not, unless otherwise directed by order of the Department, be subject to tariff posting, notification or subscription requirements set forth in 49 U.S.C. 41504 or [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs.md|14 CFR part 221]], except as provided in [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0293 International passenger transportation.md#§293.21   Incorporation of contract terms by reference.|§293.21]].

### §293.21   Incorporation of contract terms by reference.

Carriers holding an effective exemption from the duty to file tariffs under this part may incorporate contract terms by reference (*i.e.,* without stating their full text) into the passenger ticket or other document embodying the contract of carriage for the scheduled transportation of passengers in foreign air transportation, provided that:

\(a\) The notice, inspection, explanation and other requirements set forth in 14 CFR 221.107, paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) are complied with, to the extent applicable;

\(b\) In addition to other remedies at law, a carrier may not claim the benefit under this section as against a passenger, and a passenger shall not be bound by incorporation of any contract term by reference under this part, unless the requirements of paragraph (a), of this section are complied with, to the extent applicable; and

\(c\) The purpose of this section is to set uniform disclosure requirements, which preempt any State requirements on the same subject, for incorporation of terms by reference into contracts of carriage for the scheduled transportation of passengers in foreign air transportation.

### §293.22   Effectiveness of tariffs on file.

\(a\) One hundred and eighty days after the date of effectiveness of the Assistant Secretary's notice, passenger tariffs on file with the Department covered by the scope of the exemption will cease to be effective as tariffs under 49 U.S.C. 41504 and 41510, and the provisions of [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs.md|14 CFR part 221]], and will be canceled by operation of law.

\(b\) One hundred and eighty days after the date of effectiveness of the Assistant Secretary's notice, pending applications for filing and/or effectiveness of any passenger tariffs covered by the scope of the exemption, will be dismissed by operation of law. No new filings or applications will be permitted after the date of effectiveness of the Assistant Secretary's notice except as provided under [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0293 International passenger transportation.md#§293.12   Revocation of exemption.|§293.12]].
