\(5\) *Personal liability rules.* Except as provided in this part, no provision of the Department's regulations issued under this part or elsewhere shall be construed to require the filing of any tariff rules stating any limitation on, or condition relating to, the carrier's liability for personal injury or death. No subsequent regulation issued by the Department shall be construed to supersede or modify this rule of construction except to the extent that such regulation shall do so in express terms.

\(6\) *Notice of limitation of liability for death or injury under the Warsaw Convention.* Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (a)(5) of this section, each air carrier and foreign air carrier shall publish in its tariffs a provision stating whether it avails itself of the limitation on liability to passengers as provided in Article 22(1) of the Warsaw Convention or whether it has elected to agree to a higher limit of liability by a tariff provision.

\(b\) *Suspended matter not to be changed.* A fare, charge, or other tariff provision which is suspended by the Department shall not be changed in any respect or withdrawn or the effective date thereof further deferred except by authority of an order or special tariff permission of the Department.

\(c\) *Suspension continues former matter in effect.* If a tariff publication containing matter suspended by the Department directs the cancellation of a tariff or any portion thereof, which contains fares, charges, or other tariff provisions sought to be amended by the suspended matter, such cancellation is automatically suspended for the same period insofar as it purports to cancel any tariff provisions sought to be amended by the suspended matter.

\(d\) *Matter continued in effect not to be changed.* A fare, charge, or other tariff provision which is continued in effect as a result of a suspension by the Department shall not be changed during the period of suspension unless the change is authorized by order or special tariff permission of the Department, except that such matter may be reissued without change during the period of suspension.

### §221.81   Suspension supplement.

\(a\) *Suspension supplement.* Upon receipt of an order of the Department suspending any tariff publication in part or in its entirety, the carrier or agent who issued such tariff publication shall immediately issue and file with the Department a consecutively numbered supplement for the purpose of announcing such suspension.

\(b\) The suspension supplement shall not contain an effective date and it shall contain the suspension notice required by paragraph (c) of this section.

\(c\) *Suspension notice.* The suspension supplement shall contain a prominent notice of suspension which shall:

\(1\) Indicate what particular fares, charges, or other tariff provisions are under suspension,

\(2\) State the date to which such tariff matter is suspended,

\(3\) State the Department's docket number and order number which suspended such tariff matter, and

\(4\) Give specific reference to the tariffs (specifying their D.O.T. or other identifying numbers), original or revised records and paragraphs or provisions which contain the fares, charges, or other tariff provisions continued in effect.

### §221.82   Reissue of matter continued in effect by suspension to be canceled upon termination of suspension.

When tariff provisions continued in effect by a suspension are reissued during the period of such suspension, the termination of the suspension and the coming into effect of the suspended matter will not accomplish the cancellation of such reissued matter. In such circumstances, prompt action shall be taken by the issuing agent or carrier to cancel such reissued provisions upon the termination of the suspension in order that they will not conflict with the provisions formerly under suspension.

### §221.83   Tariff must be amended to make suspended matter effective.

\(a\) When the Department vacates an order which suspended certain tariff matter in full or in part, such matter will not become effective until the termination of the suspension period unless the issuing agent or carrier amends the pertinent tariffs in the manner prescribed in this subpart (except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section).

\(b\) If the Department vacates its suspension order prior to the original published effective date of the tariff provisions whose suspension is vacated, such provisions will become effective on their published effective date.

### §221.84   Cancellation of suspended matter subsequent to date to which suspended.

\(a\) *Endeavor to cancel prior to expiration of suspension period.* When an order of the Department requires the cancellation of tariff provisions which were suspended by the Department and such cancellation is required to be made effective on or before a date which is after the date to which such tariff provisions were suspended, the issuing carrier or agent shall, if possible, make the cancellation effective prior to the date to which such tariff provisions were suspended.

\(b\) *When necessary to republish matter continued in effect by suspension.* If suspended tariff provisions become effective upon expiration of their suspension period and thereby accomplish the cancellation of the tariff provisions continued in effect by the suspension, the issuing agent or carrier shall republish and reestablish such canceled tariff provisions effective simultaneously with the cancellation of the suspended provisions in compliance with the Department's order. The tariff amendments which reestablish such canceled tariff provisions shall bear reference to this subpart and the Department's order.

## Subpart J—Filing Tariff Publications With Department

\(2\) At least 25 days before they are to become effective, for matching tariffs that are to become effective on the same date as the tariff to be matched and that meet competition as described in [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs.md#§221.94   Explanation and data supporting tariff changes and new matter in tariffs.|§221.94]](c)(1)(v); and

\(3\) At least 60 days before they are to become effective, for all other tariffs.

### §221.92   Number of copies required.

Two copies of each paper tariff, tariff revision and adoption notice to be filed shall be sent to the Office of International Aviation, Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20428. All such copies shall be included in one package and shall be accompanied by a letter of tariff transmittal.

### §221.93   Concurrences or powers of attorney not previously filed to accompany tariff transmittal.

When a tariff is filed on behalf of a carrier participating therein under authority of its concurrence or power of attorney, such concurrence or power of attorney shall, if not previously filed with the Department, be transmitted at the same time such tariff is submitted for filing.

### §221.94   Explanation and data supporting tariff changes and new matter in tariffs.

When a tariff is filed with the Department which contains new or changed local or joint fares or charges for foreign air transportation, or new or changed classifications, rules, regulations, or practices affecting such fares or charges, or the value of the service thereunder, the issuing air carrier, foreign air carrier, or agent shall submit with the filing of such tariff:

\(a\) An explanation of the new or changed matter and the reasons for the filing, including (if applicable) the basis of rate making employed. Where a tariff is filed pursuant to an intercarrier agreement approved by the Department, the explanation shall identify such agreement by DOT Docket number, DOT order of approval number, IATA resolution number, or if none is designated, then by other definite identification. Where a tariff is filed on behalf of a foreign air carrier pursuant to a Government order, a copy of such order shall be submitted with the tariff.

\(b\) Appropriate Economic data and/or information in support of the new or changed matter.

\(c\) *Exceptions.* (1) The requirement for data and/or information in paragraph (b) of this section will not apply to tariff publications containing new or changed matter which are filed:

\(i\) In response to Department orders or specific policy pronouncements of the Department directly related to such new or changed matter;

\(ii\) Pursuant to an intercarrier agreement approved by the Department setting forth the fares, charges (or specific formulas therefor) or other matter: Provided that the changes are submitted with the number of the DOT order of approval and fully comply with any conditions set forth in that order;

\(iii\) To the extent fares for scheduled passenger service are within a statutory or Department-established zone of fare flexibility; and

\(iv\) To meet competition: Provided, that

\(A\) Changed matter will be deemed to have been filed to meet competition only when it effects decreases in fares or charges and/or increases the value of service so that the level of the fares or charges and the services provided will be substantially similar to the level of fares or charges and the services of a competing carrier or carriers.

\(B\) New matter will be deemed to have been filed to meet competition only when it establishes or affects a fare or charge and a service which will be substantially similar to the fares or charges and the services of a competing carrier or carriers.

\(C\) When new or changed matter is filed to meet competition over a portion of the filing air carrier's system and is simultaneously made applicable to the balance of the system, such matter, insofar as it applies over the balance of the system, will be deemed to be within the exception in this paragraph (c)(1)(iv) of this section only if such carrier submits an explanation as to the necessity of maintaining uniformity over its entire system with respect to such new or changed matter.

\(D\) In any case where new or changed matter is filed to meet competition, the filing carrier or agent must supply, as part of the filing justification, the complete tariff references which will serve to identify the competing tariff matter which the tariff purports to meet. In such case the justification or attachment shall state whether the new or changed matter is identical to the competing tariff matter which it purports to meet or whether it approximates the competing tariff matter. If the new or changed matter is not identical, the transmittal letter or attachment shall contain a statement explaining, in reasonable detail, the basis for concluding that the tariff publication being filed is substantially similar to the competing tariff matter.

In addition, a complete file of all tariffs of this company, with indexes thereof, is maintained and kept available for public inspection at. (Here indicate the place or places where complete tariff files are maintained, including the street address, and where appropriate, the room number.)

</div>

### §221.105   Special notice of limited liability under international treaty.

(a)(1) In addition to the other requirements of this subpart, each air carrier and foreign air carrier which, to any extent, avails itself of the limitation on liability to passengers provided by an international treaty, shall, at the time of delivery of the ticket, furnish to each passenger whose transportation is governed by the international treaty and whose place of departure or place of destination is in the United States, the following statement in writing:

### Advice to International Passengers on Limitations of Liability

Passengers embarking upon a journey involving an ultimate destination or a stop in a country other than the country of departure are advised that the provisions of an international treaty (the Warsaw Convention, the 1999 Montreal Convention, or other treaty), as well as a carrier's own contract of carriage or tariff provisions, may be applicable to their entire journey, including any portion entirely within the countries of departure and destination. The applicable treaty governs and may limit the liability of carriers to passengers for death or personal injury, destruction or loss of, or damage to, baggage, and for delay of passengers and baggage.

Additional protection can usually be obtained by purchasing insurance from a private company. Such insurance is not affected by any limitation of the carrier's liability under an international treaty. For further information please consult your airline or insurance company representative.

\(2\) The statement prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section shall be printed or displayed in type at least as large as 10-point modern type and in a form that contrasts with the stock or background on:

\(i\) Each ticket, including electronic tickets;

\(ii\) A piece of paper either placed in the ticket envelope with the ticket or attached to the ticket; or

\(iii\) The ticket envelope.

\(3\) When a carrier is a signatory of a Department-approved intercarrier agreement implementing an international treaty, and such agreement contains specific text a carrier may use as a notice to international passengers regarding carrier liability, the carrier may substitute the exact text contained in the intercarrier agreement in lieu of the required text of the notice quoted in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

\(b\) By December 31, 2019, each air carrier and foreign air carrier which, to any extent, avails itself of the limitation on liability to passengers provided by an international treaty, shall also cause to be displayed continuously in a conspicuous public place at each desk, station, and position in the United States which is in the charge of a person employed exclusively by it or by it jointly with another person, or by any agent employed by such air carrier or foreign air carrier to sell tickets to passengers whose transportation may be governed by an international treaty and whose place of departure or destination may be in the United States, a sign which shall have printed thereon the statement prescribed in paragraph (a)(1) of this section.

\(c\) It shall be the responsibility of each carrier to ensure that travel agents authorized to sell air transportation for such carrier comply with the notice provisions of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section.

\(d\) Any air carrier or foreign air carrier subject to the provisions of this section which wishes to use a notice of limited liability of its own wording, but containing the substance of the language prescribed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, may substitute a notice of its own wording upon approval by the Department.

\(e\) The requirements as to time and method of delivery of the notice (including the size of type) specified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and the requirement with respect to travel agents specified in paragraph (c) of this section may be waived by the Department upon application and showing by the carrier that special and unusual circumstances render the enforcement of the regulations impractical and unduly burdensome and that adequate alternative means of giving notice are employed.

\(f\) Applications for relief under paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section shall be filed with the Department's Office of International Aviation not later than 15 days before the date on which such relief is requested to become effective.

\(g\) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, no air taxi operator subject to part 298 of this subchapter shall be required to give the notices prescribed in this section, either in its capacity as an air carrier or in its capacity as an agent for an air carrier or foreign air carrier.

The subscription service described in this section shall not preclude the offering of additional types of subscription services by carriers or their agents.

\(c\) The carriers or their publishing agents at their option may establish a charge for providing the required subscription service to subscribers: Provided, That the charge may not exceed a reasonable estimate of the added cost of providing the service.

## Subpart L—Rejection of Tariff Publications

### §221.110   Department's authority to reject.

The Department may reject any tariff which is not consistent with section 41504 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII, with the regulations in this part, or with Department orders.

### §221.111   Notification of rejection.

When a tariff is rejected, the issuing carrier or agent thereof will be notified electronically or in writing that the tariff is rejected and of the reason for such rejection.

### §221.112   Rejected tariff is void and must not be used.

## Subpart M—Special Tariff Permission To File on Less Than Statutory Notice

### §221.120   Grounds for approving or denying Special Tariff Permission applications.

\(a\) *General authority.* The Department may permit changes in fares, charges or other tariff provisions on less than the statutory notice required by section 41505 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII.

\(b\) *Grounds for approval.* The following facts and circumstances constitute some of the grounds for approving applications for Special Tariff Permission in the absence of other facts and circumstances warranting denial:

\(1\) *Clerical or typographical errors.* Clerical or typographical errors in tariffs constitute grounds for approving applications for Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice the tariff changes necessary to correct such errors. Each application for Special Tariff Permission based on such grounds shall plainly specify the errors and contain a complete statement of all the attending facts and circumstances, and such application shall be presented to the Department with reasonable promptness after issuance of the defective tariff.

\(2\) *Rejection caused by clerical or typographical errors or unintelligibility.* Rejection of a tariff caused by clerical or typographical errors constitute grounds for approving applications for Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice, effective not earlier than the original effective dates in the rejected tariff, all changes contained in the rejected tariff but with the errors corrected. Each application for the grant of Special Tariff Permission based on such grounds shall plainly specify the errors and contain a complete statement of all the attending facts and circumstances, and such application shall be filed with the Department within five days after receipt of the Department's notice of rejection.

\(3\) *Newly authorized transportation.* The fact that the Department has newly authorized a carrier to perform foreign air transportation constitutes grounds for approving applications for Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice the fares, rates, and other tariff provisions covering such newly authorized transportation.

\(4\) The fact that a passenger fare is within a statutory or Department-established zone of fare flexibility constitutes grounds for approving an application for Special Tariff Permission to file a tariff stating that fare and any rules affecting them exclusively, on less than statutory notice. The Department's policy on approving such applications is set forth in [[Volume 4/F Policy statements/0399 Statements of general policy.md#§399.35   Special tariff permission.|§399.35]] of this chapter.

\(5\) *Lowered fares and charges.* The prospective lowering of fares or charges to the traveling public constitutes grounds for approving an application for Special Tariff Permission to file on less than statutory notice a tariff stating the lowered fares or charges and any rules affecting them exclusively. However, the Department will not approve the application if the proposed tariff raises significant questions of lawfulness, as set forth in [[Volume 4/F Policy statements/0399 Statements of general policy.md#§399.35   Special tariff permission.|§399.35]] of this chapter.

\(c\) *Filing notice required by formal order.* When a formal order of the Department requires the filing of tariff matter on a stated number of days' notice, an application for Special Tariff Permission to file on less notice will not be approved. In any such instance a petition for modification of the order should be filed in the formal docket.

### §221.121   How to prepare and file applications for Special Tariff Permission.

\(a\) *Form.* Each application for Special Tariff Permission to file a tariff on less than statutory notice shall conform to the requirements of [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs.md#§221.212   Special tariff permission.|§221.212]] if filed electronically.

\(b\) *Number of paper copies and place of filing.* For paper format applications, the original and one copy of each such application for Special Tariff Permission, including all exhibits thereto and amendments thereof, shall be sent to the Office of International Aviation, Department of Transportation, Washington, DC 20590.

\(c\) *Who may make application.* Applications for Special Tariff Permission to file fares, or other tariff provisions on less than statutory notice shall be made only by the issuing carrier or agent authorized to issue and file the proposed tariff. Such application by the issuing carrier or agent will constitute application on behalf of all carriers participating in the proposed fares, or other tariff provisions.

\(d\) *When notice is required.* Notice in the manner set forth in paragraph (e) of this section is required when a carrier files an application for Special Tariff Permission:

\(1\) To offer passenger fares that would be outside a Department-established zone of price flexibility or, in markets for which the Department has not established such a zone, outside the statutory zone of price flexibility; or

\(2\) To file any price increase or rule change that the carrier believes is likely to be controversial.

\(e\) *Form of notice.* When notice of filing of a Special Tariff Permission application affecting passenger fares is required by paragraph (d) of this section, the carrier shall, when it files the application, give immediate telegraphic notice or other notice approved by the Office of International Aviation, to all certificated and foreign route carriers authorized to provide nonstop or one-stop service in the markets involved, and to civic parties that would be substantially affected. The application shall include a list of the parties notified.

### §221.122   Special Tariff Permission to be used in its entirety as granted.

Each Special Tariff Permission to file fares, or other tariff provisions on less than statutory notice shall be used in its entirety as granted. If it is not desired to use the permission as granted, and lesser or more extensive or different permission is desired, a new application for Special Tariff Permission conforming with [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs.md#§221.121   How to prepare and file applications for Special Tariff Permission.|§221.121]] in all respects and referring to the previous permission shall be filed.

### §221.123   Re-use of Special Tariff Permission when tariff is rejected.

If a tariff containing matter issued under Special Tariff Permission is rejected, the same Special Tariff Permission may be used in a tariff issued in lieu of such rejected tariff provided that such re-use is not precluded by the terms of the Special Tariff Permission, and is made within the time limit thereof or within seven days after the date of the Department's notice of rejection, whichever is later, but in no event later than fifteen days after the expiration of the time limit specified in the Special Tariff Permission.

## Subpart N—Waiver of Tariff Regulations

### §221.130   Applications for waiver of tariff regulations.

Applications for waiver or modification of any of the requirements of this part 221 or for modification of chapter 415 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII with respect to the filing and posting of tariffs shall be made by the issuing carrier or issuing agent.

### §221.131   Form of application for waivers.

Applications for waivers shall be in the form of a letter addressed to the Office of International Aviation, Department of Transportation Washington, DC 20590, and shall:

\(a\) Specify (by section and paragraph) the particular regulation which the applicant desires the Department to waive.

\(b\) Show in detail how the proposed provisions will be shown in the tariff under authority of such waiver if granted (submitting exhibits of the proposed provision where necessary to clearly show this information).

\(c\) Set forth all facts and circumstances on which the applicant relies as warranting the Department's granting the authority requested. No tariff or other documents shall be filed pursuant to such application prior to the Department's granting the authority requested.

## Subpart O—Giving and Revoking Concurrences to Carriers

### §221.140   Method of giving concurrence.

\(a\) A concurrence prepared in a manner acceptable to the Office of International Aviation shall be used by a carrier to give authority to another carrier to issue and file with the Department tariffs which contain joint fares or charges, including provisions governing such fares or charges, applying to, from, or via points served by the carrier giving the concurrence. A concurrence shall not be used as authority to file joint fares or charges in which the carrier to whom the concurrence is given does not participate, and it shall not be used as authority to file local fares or charges.

\(b\) *Number of copies.* Each concurrence shall be prepared in triplicate. The original of each concurrence shall be filed with the Department, the duplicate thereof shall be given to the carrier in whose favor the concurrence is issued, and the third copy shall be retained by the carrier who issued the concurrence.

\(c\) *Conflicting authority to be avoided.* Care should be taken to avoid giving authority to two or more carriers which, if used, would result in conflicting or duplicate tariff provisions.

### §221.141   Method of revoking concurrence.

\(a\) A concurrence may be revoked by filing with the Department a Notice of Revocation of Concurrence prepared in a form acceptable to the Office of International Aviation.

\(b\) *Sixty days' notice required.* Such Notice of Revocation of Concurrence shall be filed on not less than sixty days' notice to the Department. A Notice of Revocation of Concurrence will be deemed to be filed only upon its actual receipt by the Department, and the period of notice shall commence to run only from such actual receipt.

\(c\) *Number of copies.* Each Notice of Revocation of Concurrence shall be prepared in triplicate. The original thereof shall be filed with the Department and, at the same time that the original is transmitted to the Department, the duplicate thereof shall be sent to the carrier to whom the concurrence was given. The third copy shall be retained by the carrier issuing such notice.

\(d\) Amendment of tariffs when concurrence revoked. When a concurrence is revoked, a corresponding amendment of the tariff or tariffs affected shall be made by the issuing carrier of such tariffs, on not less than statutory notice, to become effective not later than the effective date stated in the Notice of Revocation of Concurrence. In the event of failure to so amend the tariff or tariffs, the provisions therein shall remain applicable until lawfully canceled.

### §221.142   Method of withdrawing portion of authority conferred by concurrence.

If a carrier desires to issue a concurrence conferring less authority than a previous concurrence given to the same carrier, the new concurrence shall not direct the cancellation of such previous concurrence. In such circumstances, such previous concurrence shall be revoked by issuing and filing a Notice of Revocation of Concurrence in a form acceptable to the Office of International Aviation. Such revocation notice shall include reference to the new concurrence.

## Subpart P—Giving and Revoking Powers of Attorney to Agents

### §221.150   Method of giving power of attorney.

\(a\) *Prescribed form of power of attorney.* A power of attorney prepared in accordance with a form acceptable to the Office of International Aviation shall be used by a carrier to give authority to an agent and (in the case of the agent being an individual) such agent's alternate to issue and file with the Department tariffs which contain local or joint fares or charges, including provisions governing such fares or charges, applicable via and for account of such carrier. Agents may be only natural persons or corporations (other than incorporated associations of air carriers). The authority conferred in a power of attorney may not be delegated to any other person.

\(b\) *Designation of tariff issuing person by corporate agent.* When a corporation has been appointed as agent it shall forward to the Department a certified excerpt of the minutes of the meeting of its Board of Directors designating by name and title the person responsible for issuing tariffs and filing them with the Department. Only one such person may be designated by a corporate agent, and the title of such designee shall not contain the word “Agent”. When such a designee is replaced the Department shall be immediately notified in like manner of his successor. An officer or employee of an incorporated tariff-publishing agent may not be authorized to act as tariff agent in his/her individual capacity. Every tariff issued by a corporate agent shall be issued in its name as agent.

\(c\) *Number of copies.* Each power of attorney shall be prepared in triplicate. The original of each power of attorney shall be filed with the Department, the duplicate thereof shall be given to the agent in whose favor the power of attorney is issued, and the third copy shall be retained by the carrier who issued the power of attorney.

\(d\) *Conflicting authority prohibited.* In giving powers of attorney, carriers shall not give authority to two or more agents which, if used, would result in conflicting or duplicate tariff provisions.

### §221.151   Method of revoking power of attorney.

\(a\) A power of attorney may be revoked only by filing with the Department in the manner specified in this section a Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney in a form acceptable to the Office of International Aviation.

\(b\) *Sixty days' notice required.* Such Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney shall be filed on not less than sixty days' notice to the Department. A Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney will be deemed to be filed only upon its actual receipt by the Department, and the period of notice shall commence to run only from such actual receipt.

\(c\) *Number of copies.* Each Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney shall be prepared in triplicate. The original thereof shall be filed with the Department and, at the same time that the original is transmitted to the Department, the duplicate thereof shall be sent to the agent in whose favor the power of attorney was issued (except, if the alternate agent has taken over the tariffs, the duplicate of the Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney shall be sent to the alternate agent). The third copy of the notice shall be retained by the carrier.

\(d\) *Amendment of tariffs when power of attorney is revoked.* When a power of attorney is revoked, a corresponding amendment of the tariff or tariffs affected shall be made by the issuing agent of such tariffs, on not less than statutory notice, to become effective not later than the effective date stated in the Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney. In the event of failure to so amend the tariff or tariffs, the provisions therein shall remain applicable until lawfully canceled.

### §221.152   Method of withdrawing portion of authority conferred by power of attorney.

If a carrier desires to issue a power of attorney conferring less authority than a previous power of attorney issued in favor of the same agent, the new power of attorney shall not direct the cancellation of such previous power of attorney. In such circumstances, such previous power of attorney shall be revoked by issuing and filing a Notice of Revocation of Power of Attorney in a form acceptable to the Office of International Aviation. Such revocation notice shall include reference to the new power of attorney.

## Subpart Q—Adoption Publications Required To Show Change in Carrier's Name or Transfer of Operating Control

### §221.160   Adoption notice.

\(a\) When the name of a carrier is changed or when its operating control is transferred to another carrier (including another company which has not previously been a carrier), the carrier which will thereafter operate the properties shall immediately issue, file with the Department, and post for public inspection, an adoption notice in a form and containing such information as is approved by the Office of International Aviation. (The carrier under its former name or the carrier from whom the operating control is transferred shall be referred to in this subpart as the “former carrier”, and the carrier under its new name or the carrier, company, or fiduciary to whom the operating control is transferred shall be referred to in this subpart as the “adopting carrier”.)

\(b\) The adoption notice shall be prepared, filed, and posted as a tariff. The adoption notice shall be issued and filed by the adopting carrier and not by an agent.

\(c\) *Copies to be sent to agents and other carriers.* At the same time that the adoption notice is transmitted to the Department for filing, the adopting carrier shall send copies of such adoption notice to each agent and carrier to whom the former carrier has given a power of attorney or concurrence. (See [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs.md#§221.163   Agents' and other carriers' tariffs shall reflect adoption.|§221.163]].)

### §221.161   Notice of adoption to be filed in former carrier's tariffs.

At the same time that the adoption notice is issued, posted, and filed pursuant to [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs.md#§221.160   Adoption notice.|§221.160]], the adopting carrier shall issue, post and file with the Department a notice in each effective tariff issued by the former carrier providing specific notice of the adoption in a manner authorized by the Office of International Aviation and which shall contain no matter other than that authorized.

### §221.162   Receiver shall file adoption notices.

A receiver shall, immediately upon assuming control of a carrier, issue and file with the Department an adoption notices as prescribed by §[[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs.md#§221.160   Adoption notice.|§221.160]] and 221.161 and shall comply with the requirements of this subpart.

### §221.163   Agents' and other carriers' tariffs shall reflect adoption.

If the former carrier is shown as a participating carrier under concurrence in tariffs issued by other carriers or is shown as a participating carrier under power of attorney in tariffs issued by agents, the issuing carriers and agents of such tariffs shall, upon receipt of the adoption notice, promptly file on statutory notice the following amendments to their respective tariffs:

\(a\) Cancel the name of the former carrier from the list of participating carriers.

\(b\) Add the adopting carrier (in alphabetical order) to the list of participating carriers. If the adopting carrier already participates in such tariff, reference to the substitution notice shall be added in connection with such carrier's name in the list of participating carriers.

### §221.164   Concurrences or powers of attorney to be reissued.

\(a\) Adopting carrier shall reissue adopted concurrences and powers of attorney. Within a period of 120 days after the date on which the change in name or transfer of operating control occurs, the adopting carrier shall reissue all effective powers of attorney and concurrences of the former carrier by issuing and filing new powers of attorney and concurrences, in the adopting carrier's name, which shall direct the cancellation of the respective powers of attorney and concurrences of the former carrier. The adopting carrier shall consecutively number its powers of attorney and concurrences in its own series of power of attorney numbers and concurrence numbers (commencing with No. 1 in each series if it had not previously filed any such instruments with the Department), except that a receiver or other fiduciary shall consecutively number its powers of attorney or concurrences in the series of the former carrier. The cancellation reference shall show that the canceled power of attorney or concurrence was issued by the former carrier.

\(b\) If such new powers of attorney or concurrences confer less authority than the powers of attorney or concurrences which they are to supersede, the new issues shall not direct the cancellation of the former issues; in such instances, the provisions of §[[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs.md#§221.142   Method of withdrawing portion of authority conferred by concurrence.|§221.142]] and 221.152 shall be observed. Concurrences and powers of attorney which will not be replaced by new issues shall be revoked in the form and manner and upon the notice required by §[[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs.md#§221.141   Method of revoking concurrence.|§221.141]] and 221.151.

\(c\) *Reissue of other carriers' concurrences issued in favor of former carrier.* Each carrier which has given a concurrence to a carrier whose tariffs are subsequently adopted shall reissue the concurrence in favor of the adopting carrier. If the carrier which issued the concurrence to the former carrier desires to revoke it or desires to replace it with a concurrence conferring less authority, the provisions of §[[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs.md#§221.141   Method of revoking concurrence.|§221.141]] and 221.142 shall be observed.

### §221.165   Cessation of operations without successor.

If a carrier ceases operations without having a successor, it shall:

\(a\) File a notice in each tariff of its own issue and cancel such tariff in its entirety.

\(b\) Revoke all powers of attorney and concurrences which it has issued.

## Subpart R—Electronically Filed Tariffs

### §221.170   Applicability of the subpart.

\(a\) Every air carrier and foreign air carrier shall file its international passenger fares tariffs consistent with the provisions of this subpart, and part 221 generally. Additionally, any air carrier and any foreign air carrier may file its international passenger rules tariffs electronically in machine-readable form as an alternative to the filing of printed paper tariffs as provided for elsewhere in part 221. This subpart applies to all carriers and tariff publishing agents and may be used by either if the carrier or agent complies with the provisions of subpart R. Any carrier or agent that files electronically under this subpart must transmit to the Department the remainder of the tariff in a form consistent with part 221, Subparts A through Q, on the same day that the electronic tariff would be deemed received under [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0221 Tariffs.md#§221.190   Time for filing and computation of time periods.|§221.190]](b).

\(b\) To the extent that subpart R is inconsistent with the remainder of part 221, subpart R shall govern the filing of electronic tariffs. In all other respects, part 221 remains in full force and effect.

### §221.180   Requirements for electronic filing of tariffs.

The filer shall be required to make data fields available to the Department in any record which is part of the on-line tariff database.

\(7\) The filer shall maintain all fares and rules filed with the Department and all Departmental approvals, disapprovals and other actions, as well as all Departmental notations concerning such approvals, disapprovals or other actions, in the on-line tariff database for a period of two (2) years after the fare or rule becomes inactive. After this period of time, the carrier or agent shall provide the Department, free of charge, with a copy of the inactive data on a machine-readable tape or other mutually acceptable electronic medium.

\(8\) The filer shall ensure that its on-line tariff database is secure against destruction or alteration (except as authorized by the Department), and against tampering.

\(9\) Should the filer terminate its business or cease filing tariffs, it shall provide to the Department on a machine-readable tape or any other mutually acceptable electronic medium, contemporaneously with the cessation of such business, a complete copy of its on-line tariff database.

\(10\) The filer shall furnish to the Department, on a daily basis, on a machine-readable tape or any other mutually acceptable electronic medium, all transactions made to its on-line tariff database.

\(11\) The filer shall afford any authorized Departmental official full, free, and uninhibited access to its facilities, databases, documentation, records, and application programs, including support functions, environmental security, and accounting data, for the purpose of ensuring continued effectiveness of safeguards against threats and hazards to the security or integrity of its electronic tariffs, as defined in this subpart.
