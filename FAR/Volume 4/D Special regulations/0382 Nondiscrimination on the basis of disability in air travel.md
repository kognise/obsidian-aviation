\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 78 FR 67914, Nov. 12, 2013; Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020\]

### §382.5   When are U.S. and foreign carriers required to begin complying with the provisions of this part?

As a U.S. or foreign carrier, you are required to comply with the requirements of this part on May 13, 2009, except as otherwise provided in individual sections of this part.

### §382.7   To whom do the provisions of this part apply?

\(a\) If you are a U.S. carrier, this Part applies to you with respect to all your operations and aircraft, regardless of where your operations take place, except as otherwise provided in this part.

\(b\) If you are a foreign carrier, this part applies to you only with respect to flights you operate that begin or end at a U.S. airport and to aircraft used for these flights. For purposes of this part, a “flight” means a continuous journey in the same aircraft or with one flight number that begins or ends at a U.S. airport. The following are some examples of the application of this term:

<div>

*Example 1 to paragraph (b):* A passenger books a nonstop flight on a foreign carrier from New York to Frankfurt, or Frankfurt to New York. Each of these is a “flight” for purposes of this Part.

</div>

<div>

*Example 2 to paragraph (b):* A passenger books a journey on a foreign carrier from New York to Prague. The foreign carrier flies nonstop to Frankfurt. The passenger gets off the plane in Frankfurt and boards a connecting flight (with a different flight number), on the same foreign carrier or a different carrier, which goes to Prague. The New York-Frankfurt leg of the journey is a “flight” for purposes of this Part; the Frankfurt-Prague leg is not. On the reverse routing, the Prague-Frankfurt leg is not a covered flight for purposes of this Part, while the Frankfurt-New York leg is.

</div>

<div>

*Example 3 to paragraph (b):* A passenger books a journey on a foreign carrier from New York to Prague. The plane stops for refueling and a crew change in Frankfurt. If, after deplaning in Frankfurt, the passengers originating in New York reboard the aircraft (or a different aircraft, assuming the flight number remains the same) and continue to Prague, they remain on a covered flight for purposes of this Part. This is because their transportation takes place on a direct flight between New York and Prague, even though it had an interim stop in Frankfurt. This example would also apply in the opposite direction (Prague to New York via Frankfurt).

</div>

<div>

*Example 4 to paragraph (b):* In Example 3, the foreign carrier is not subject to coverage under this Part with respect to a Frankfurt-originating passenger who boards the aircraft and goes to Prague, or a Prague-originating passenger who gets off the plane in Frankfurt and does not continue to New York.

</div>

\(c\) As a foreign carrier, you are not subject to the requirements of this part with respect to flights between two foreign points, even with respect to flights involving code-sharing arrangements with U.S. carriers. As a U.S. carrier that participates in a code-sharing arrangement with a foreign carrier with respect to flights between two foreign points, you (as distinct from the foreign carrier) are responsible for ensuring compliance with the service provisions of subparts A through C, E through H, and K of this part, with respect to passengers traveling under your code on such a flight.

<div>

*Example 1 to paragraph (c):* A passenger buys a ticket from a U.S. carrier for a journey from New York to Prague. The ticket carries the U.S. carrier's code and flight number throughout the entire journey. There is a change of carrier and aircraft in Frankfurt, and a foreign carrier operates the Frankfurt-Prague segment. The foreign carrier is not subject to the provisions of Part 382 for the Frankfurt-Prague segment. However, the U.S. carrier must ensure compliance with the applicable provisions of Part 382 on the Frankfurt-Prague segment with respect to passengers flying under its code, and the Department could take enforcement action against the U.S. carrier for acts or omissions by the foreign carrier.

</div>

\(d\) As a foreign carrier, if you operate a charter flight from a foreign airport to a U.S. airport, and return to a foreign airport, and you do not pick up any passengers in the U.S., the charter flight is not a flight subject to the requirements of this part.

\(e\) Unless a provision of this Part specifies application to a U.S. carrier or a foreign carrier, the provision applies to both U.S. and foreign carriers.

\(f\) If you are an indirect carrier, §[[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.1   What is the purpose of this part?|§382.1]] through 382.15 of this part apply to you. §[[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.17   May carriers limit the number of passengers with a disability on a flight?|§382.17]] through 382.157 of this part do not apply to you except insofar as provided by [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.11   What is the general nondiscrimination requirement of this part?|§382.11]](b).

\(g\) Notwithstanding any provisions of this part, you must comply with all FAA safety regulations, TSA security regulations, and foreign safety and security regulations having legally mandatory effect that apply to you.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11471, Mar. 18, 2009; 75 FR 44887, July 30, 2010; Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020\]

### §382.9   What may foreign carriers do if they believe a provision of a foreign nation's law conflicts with compliance with a provision of this part?

\(a\) If you are a foreign carrier, and you believe that an applicable provision of the law of a foreign nation precludes you from complying with a provision of this part, you may request a waiver of the provision of this Part.

\(b\) You must send such a waiver request to the following address: Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings, C-70 U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Room W96-322, Washington, DC 20590.

\(c\) Your waiver request must be in English and include the following elements:

\(1\) A copy, in the English language, of the foreign law involved;

\(2\) A description of how the foreign law applies and how it precludes compliance with a provision of this part;

\(3\) A description of the alternative means the carrier will use, if the waiver is granted, to effectively achieve the objective of the provision of this part subject to the waiver or, if applicable, a justification of why it would be impossible to achieve this objective in any way.

\(d\) The Department may grant the waiver request, or grant the waiver request subject to conditions, if it determines that the foreign law applies, that it does preclude compliance with a provision of this part, and that the carrier has provided an effective alternative means of achieving the objective of the provisions of this part subject to the waiver or have demonstrated by clear and convincing evidence that it would be impossible to achieve this objective in any way.

(e)(1) If you submit a waiver request on or before September 10, 2008, the Department will, to the maximum extent feasible, respond to the request before May 13, 2009. If the Department does not respond to the waiver request by May 13, 2009, you may continue to implement the policy or practice that is the subject of your request until the Department does respond. The Department will not take enforcement action with respect to your implementation of the policy or practice during the time prior to the Department's response.

\(2\) If you submit a waiver request after September 10, 2008, the Department will, to the maximum extent feasible, respond to the request by May 13, 2009 or within 180 days of receiving it, whichever is later. If the Department does not respond to the waiver request by this date, you may continue to implement the policy or practice that is the subject of your request until the Department does respond. However, the Department may take enforcement action with respect to your implementation of the policy or practice during the time between May 13, 2009 and the date of the Department's response.

\(3\) If you submit a waiver request after September 10, 2008, and the request pertains to an applicable provision of the law of a foreign nation that did not exist on September 10, 2008, you may continue to implement the policy or practice that is the subject of your request until the Department responds to the request. The Department will, to the maximum extent feasible, respond to such requests within 180 days of receiving them. The Department will not take enforcement action with respect to your implementation of the policy or practice during the time prior to the Department's response.

\(f\) Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the Department may commence enforcement action at any time after May 13, 2009 with respect to the policy or practice that is the subject of the request if it finds the request to be frivolous or dilatory.

\(g\) If you have not submitted a request for a waiver under this section with respect to a provision of this part, or such a request has been denied, you cannot raise the alleged existence of such a conflict as a defense to an enforcement action.

### §382.10   How does a U.S. or foreign carrier obtain a determination that it is providing an equivalent alternative to passengers with disabilities?

\(a\) As a U.S. or foreign carrier, you may apply to the Department for a determination that you are providing an equivalent alternative to passengers with disabilities.

\(b\) You must send your application for an equivalent alternative determination to the following address: Assistant General Counsel for Aviation Enforcement and Proceedings (C-70), U.S. Department of Transportation, 1200 New Jersey Avenue, SE., Room W96-322, Washington, DC 20590.

\(c\) Your application must be in English and include the following elements:

\(1\) A citation to the specific provision of this part concerning which you are proposing an equivalent alternative.

\(2\) A detailed description of the alternative policy, practice, or other accommodation you are proposing to use in place of compliance with the provision of this part that you cite, and an explanation of how it provides substantially equivalent accessibility to passengers with disabilities.

\(d\) The Department may grant the application, or grant the application subject to conditions, if it determines that the proposed facilitation does provide substantially equivalent accessibility to passengers with disabilities, compared to compliance with the provision of this part in question.

\(e\) If your application is granted, you will be deemed to be in compliance with this Part through implementing the equivalent alternative. If your application is denied, you must implement this part as written.

(f)(1) If you submit your application on or before September 10, 2008, the Department will respond to the request before May 13, 2009 to the maximum extent feasible. If the Department does not respond to the application by May 13, 2009, you may implement your policy or practice that is the subject of your application until the Department does respond.

\(2\) With respect to an application you make after September 10, 2008, you must comply with the provisions of this part without change from May 13, 2009 until the Department responds to your application.

## Subpart B—Nondiscrimination and Access to Services and Information

### §382.11   What is the general nondiscrimination requirement of this part?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must not do any of the following things, either directly or through a contractual, licensing, or other arrangement:

\(1\) You must not discriminate against any qualified individual with a disability, by reason of such disability, in the provision of air transportation;

\(2\) You must not require a qualified individual with a disability to accept special services (including, but not limited to, preboarding) that the individual does not request. However, you may require preboarding as a condition of receiving certain seating or in-cabin stowage accommodations, as specified in §[[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.83   Through what mechanisms do carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.83]](c), 382.85(b), and 382.123(a) of this part.

\(3\) You must not exclude a qualified individual with a disability from or deny the person the benefit of any air transportation or related services that are available to other persons, except where specifically permitted by this Part. This is true even if there are separate or different services available for individuals with a disability, except when specifically permitted by another section of this Part; and

\(4\) You must not take any adverse action against an individual (e.g., refusing to provide transportation) because the individual asserts, on his or her own behalf or through or on behalf of others, rights protected by this part or the Air Carrier Access Act.

\(b\) As an indirect carrier, you must comply with §[[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.17   May carriers limit the number of passengers with a disability on a flight?|§382.17]] through 382.157 of this part when providing facilities or services to passengers that would have otherwise been provided by a direct air carrier.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 75 FR 44887, July 30, 2010\]

### §382.13   Do carriers have to modify policies, practices, and facilities to ensure nondiscrimination?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must modify your policies, practices, and facilities when needed to provide nondiscriminatory service to a particular individual with a disability, consistent with the standards of section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, as amended.

\(b\) This requirement is part of your general nondiscrimination obligation, and is in addition to your duty to make the specific accommodations required by this part.

\(c\) However, you are not required to make modifications that would constitute an undue burden or would fundamentally alter your program.

### §382.15   Do carriers have to make sure that contractors comply with the requirements of this Part?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must make sure that your contractors that provide services to the public (including airports where applicable) meet the requirements of this part that would apply to you if you provided the services yourself.

\(b\) As a carrier, you must include an assurance of compliance with this part in your contracts with any contractors that provide services to the public that are subject to the requirements of this part. Noncompliance with this assurance is a material breach of the contract on the contractor's part.

\(1\) This assurance must commit the contractor to compliance with all applicable provisions of this Part in activities performed on behalf of the carrier.

\(2\) The assurance must also commit the contractor to implementing directives issued by your CROs under §[[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.151   What are the requirements for providing Complaints Resolution Officials?|§382.151]] through 382.153.

\(c\) As a U.S. carrier, you must also include such an assurance of compliance in your contracts or agreements of appointment with U.S. travel agents. You are not required to include such an assurance in contracts with foreign travel agents.

\(d\) You remain responsible for your contractors' compliance with this part and for enforcing the assurances in your contracts with them.

\(e\) It is not a defense against an enforcement action by the Department under this part that your noncompliance resulted from action or inaction by a contractor.

### §382.17   May carriers limit the number of passengers with a disability on a flight?

As a carrier, you must not limit the number of passengers with a disability who travel on a flight. (See also [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.27   May a carrier require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice in order to obtain certain specific services in connection with a flight?|§382.27]](c)(6) of this part.)

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11471, Mar. 18, 2009\]

### §382.19   May carriers refuse to provide transportation on the basis of disability?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must not refuse to provide transportation to a passenger with a disability on the basis of his or her disability, except as specifically permitted by this part.

\(b\) You must not refuse to provide transportation to a passenger with a disability because the person's disability results in appearance or involuntary behavior that may offend, annoy, or inconvenience crewmembers or other passengers.

\(c\) You may refuse to provide transportation to any passenger on the basis of safety, as provided in 49 U.S.C. 44902 or 14 CFR 121.533, or to any passenger whose carriage would violate FAA or TSA requirements or applicable requirements of a foreign government.

\(1\) You can determine that there is a disability-related safety basis for refusing to provide transportation to a passenger with a disability if you are able to demonstrate that the passenger poses a direct threat (see definition in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.3   What do the terms in this rule mean?|§382.3]]). In determining whether an individual poses a direct threat, you must make an individualized assessment, based on reasonable judgment that relies on current medical knowledge or on the best available objective evidence, to ascertain:

\(i\) The nature, duration, and severity of the risk;

\(ii\) The probability that the potential harm to the health and safety of others will actually occur; and

\(iii\) Whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedures will mitigate the risk.

\(2\) If you determine that the passenger does pose a direct threat, you must select the least restrictive response from the point of view of the passenger, consistent with protecting the health and safety of others. For example, you must not refuse transportation to the passenger if you can protect the health and safety of others by means short of a refusal.

\(3\) In exercising this authority, you must not act inconsistently with the provisions of this part.

\(4\) If your actions are inconsistent with any of the provisions of this part, you are subject to enforcement action under Subpart K of this part.

\(d\) If you refuse to provide transportation to a passenger on his or her originally-scheduled flight on a basis relating to the individual's disability, you must provide to the person a written statement of the reason for the refusal. This statement must include the specific basis for the carrier's opinion that the refusal meets the standards of paragraph (c) of this section or is otherwise specifically permitted by this part. You must provide this written statement to the person within 10 calendar days of the refusal of transportation.

### §382.21   May carriers limit access to transportation on the basis that a passenger has a communicable disease or other medical condition?

\(a\) You must not do any of the following things on the basis that a passenger has a communicable disease or infection, unless you determine that the passenger's condition poses a direct threat:

\(1\) Refuse to provide transportation to the passenger;

\(2\) Delay the passenger's transportation (e.g., require the passenger to take a later flight);

\(3\) Impose on the passenger any condition, restriction, or requirement not imposed on other passengers; or

\(4\) Require the passenger to provide a medical certificate.

\(b\) In assessing whether the passenger's condition poses a direct threat, you must apply the provisions of [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.19   May carriers refuse to provide transportation on the basis of disability?|§382.19]](c)(1)-(2) of this subpart.

\(1\) In making this assessment, you may rely on directives issued by public health authorities (e.g., the U.S. Centers for Disease Control or Public Health Service; comparable agencies in other countries; the World Health Organization).

\(2\) In making this assessment, you must consider the significance of the consequences of a communicable disease and the degree to which it can be readily transmitted by casual contact in an aircraft cabin environment.

<div>

*Example 1 to paragraph (b)(2):* The common cold is readily transmissible in an aircraft cabin environment but does not have severe health consequences. Someone with a cold would not pose a direct threat.

</div>

<div>

*Example 2 to paragraph (b)(2):* AIDS has very severe health consequences but is not readily transmissible in an aircraft cabin environment. Someone would not pose a direct threat because he or she is HIV-positive or has AIDS.

</div>

<div>

*Example 3 to paragraph (b)(2):* SARS may be readily transmissible in an aircraft cabin environment and has severe health consequences. Someone with SARS probably poses a direct threat.

</div>

\(c\) If a passenger with a communicable disease meeting the direct threat criteria of this section gives you a medical certificate of the kind outlined in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.23   May carriers require a passenger with a disability to provide a medical certificate?|§382.23]](c)(2) describing measures for preventing transmission of the disease during the normal course of the flight, you must provide transportation to the passenger, unless you are unable to carry out the measures.

\(d\) If your action under this section results in the postponement of a passenger's travel, you must permit the passenger to travel at a later time (up to 90 days from the date of the postponed travel) at the fare that would have applied to the passenger's originally scheduled trip without penalty or, at the passenger's discretion, provide a refund for any unused flights, including return flights.

\(e\) If you take any action under this section that restricts a passenger's travel, you must, on the passenger's request, provide a written explanation within 10 days of the request.

### §382.23   May carriers require a passenger with a disability to provide a medical certificate?

\(a\) Except as provided in this section, you must not require a passenger with a disability to have a medical certificate as a condition for being provided transportation.

(b)(1) You may require a medical certificate for a passenger with a disability—

\(i\) Who is traveling in a stretcher or incubator;

\(ii\) Who needs medical oxygen during a flight; or

\(iii\) Whose medical condition is such that there is reasonable doubt that the individual can complete the flight safely, without requiring extraordinary medical assistance during the flight.

\(2\) For purposes of this paragraph, a medical certificate is a written statement from the passenger's physician saying that the passenger is capable of completing the flight safely, without requiring extraordinary medical assistance during the flight.

\(3\) To be valid, a medical certificate under this paragraph must be dated within 10 days of the scheduled date of the passenger's initial departing flight.

<div>

*Example to paragraph (b)(3):* A passenger who schedules a flight from New York to London on January 15 with a return on April 15 would have to show a medical certificate dated January 5 or later. The passenger would not have to show a second medical certificate dated April 5 or later.

</div>

(c)(1) You may also require a medical certificate for a passenger if he or she has a communicable disease or condition that could pose a direct threat to the health or safety of others on the flight.

\(2\) For purposes of this paragraph, a medical certificate is a written statement from the passenger's physician saying that the disease or infection would not, under the present conditions in the particular passenger's case, be communicable to other persons during the normal course of a flight. The medical certificate must state any conditions or precautions that would have to be observed to prevent the transmission of the disease or infection to other persons in the normal course of a flight. A medical certificate under this paragraph must be dated within 10 days of the date of the flight for which it is presented.

\(d\) As a carrier, you may require that a passenger with a medical certificate undergo additional medical review by you if there is a legitimate medical reason for believing that there has been a significant adverse change in the passenger's condition since the issuance of the medical certificate or that the certificate significantly understates the passenger's risk to the health of other persons on the flight. If the results of this medical review demonstrate that the passenger, notwithstanding the medical certificate, is likely to be unable to complete the flight without requiring extraordinary medical assistance (e.g., the passenger has apparent significant difficulty in breathing, appears to be in substantial pain, *etc.*) or would pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other persons on the flight, you may take an action otherwise prohibited under [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.21   May carriers limit access to transportation on the basis that a passenger has a communicable disease or other medical condition?|§382.21]](a) of this part.

### §382.25   May a carrier require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice that he or she is traveling on a flight?

As a carrier, you must not require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice of the fact that he or she is traveling on a flight.

### §382.27   May a carrier require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice in order to obtain certain specific services in connection with a flight?

\(a\) Except as provided in paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section and §[[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.75   May a carrier require documentation from passengers with disabilities seeking to travel with a service animal?|§382.75]] and 382.133(e)(4), (5), (f)(5) and (6), as a carrier you must not require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice in order to obtain services or accommodations required by this part.

(b)(1) You may require a passenger with a disability to provide up to 72 hours' advance notice and check in one hour before the check-in time for the general public to receive carrier-supplied in-flight medical oxygen on international flights, and 48 hours' advance notice and check-in one hour before the check-in time for the general public to receive carrier-supplied in-flight medical oxygen on domestic flights. This service is optional; you are not required to provide carrier-supplied in-flight medical oxygen, but you may choose to do so.

\(2\) You may require a passenger with a disability to provide 48 hours' advance notice and check-in one hour before the check-in time for the general public to use his/her ventilator, respirator, CPAP machine or POC.

\(3\) You may require a passenger with a disability seeking to travel with a service animal in the cabin of the aircraft to provide up to 48 hours' advance notice through submission of the forms identified in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.75   May a carrier require documentation from passengers with disabilities seeking to travel with a service animal?|§382.75]] (a) and (b) as a condition of permitting the service animal to travel in the cabin if the reservation is made more than 48 hours prior to a flight's departure. In the alternative, you may require a passenger with a disability seeking to travel with a service animal in the cabin of the aircraft to provide the forms identified in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.75   May a carrier require documentation from passengers with disabilities seeking to travel with a service animal?|§382.75]] (a) and (b) at the passenger's departure gate on the date of travel as a condition of permitting the service animal to travel in the cabin.

\(c\) You may require a passenger with a disability to provide up to 48 hours' advance notice and check in one hour before the check-in time for the general public to receive the following services and accommodations. The services listed in paragraphs (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section are optional; you are not required to provide them, but you may choose to do so.

\(1\) Carriage of an incubator;

\(2\) Hook-up for a respirator, ventilator, CPAP machine or POC to the aircraft electrical power supply;

\(3\) Accommodation for a passenger who must travel in a stretcher;

\(4\) Transportation for an electric wheelchair on an aircraft with fewer than 60 seats;

\(5\) Provision of hazardous materials packaging for batteries or other assistive devices that are required to have such packaging;

\(6\) Accommodation for a group of ten or more qualified individuals with a disability, who make reservations and travel as a group; and

\(d\) If the passenger with a disability provides the advance notice you require, consistent with this section, for a service that you must provide (see paragraphs (b)(2) through (3) and (c)(4) through (8) of this section) or choose to provide (see paragraphs (b)(1) and (c)(1) through (c)(3) of this section), you must provide the requested service or accommodation except to comply with any applicable safety regulations.

\(e\) Your reservation and other administrative systems must ensure that when passengers provide the advance notice that you require, consistent with this section, for services and accommodations, the notice is communicated, clearly and on time, to the people responsible for providing the requested service or accommodation.

\(f\) If a passenger with a disability provides the advance notice you require, consistent with this section, and the passenger is forced to change to another flight (*e.g.,* because of a flight cancellation), you must, to the maximum extent feasible, provide the accommodation on the new flight. If the new flight is another carrier's flight, you must provide the maximum feasible assistance to the other carrier in providing the accommodation the passenger requested from you.

\(g\) If a passenger does not meet advance notice or check-in requirements you establish consistent with this section, you must still provide the service or accommodation if you can do so by making reasonable efforts, without delaying the flight.

### §382.29   May a carrier require a passenger with a disability to travel with a safety assistant?

\(a\) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, you must not require that a passenger with a disability travel with another person as a condition of being provided air transportation.

\(b\) You may require a passenger with a disability in one of the following categories to travel with a safety assistant as a condition of being provided air transportation, if you determine that a safety assistant is essential for safety:

\(1\) A passenger traveling in a stretcher or incubator. The safety assistant for such a person must be capable of attending to the passenger's in-flight medical needs;

\(2\) A passenger who, because of a mental disability, is unable to comprehend or respond appropriately to safety instructions from carrier personnel, including the safety briefing required by 14 CFR 121.571(a)(3) and (a)(4) or 14 CFR 135.117(b) or the safety regulations of a foreign carrier's government, as applicable;

\(3\) A passenger with a mobility impairment so severe that the person is unable to physically assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft;

\(4\) A passenger who has both severe hearing and severe vision impairments, if the passenger cannot establish some means of communication with carrier personnel that is adequate both to permit transmission of the safety briefing required by 14 CFR 121.57(a)(3) and (a)(4), 14 CFR 135,117(b) or the safety regulations of a foreign carrier's government, as applicable, and to enable the passenger to assist in his or her own evacuation of the aircraft in the event of an emergency. You may require a passenger with severe hearing and vision impairment who wishes to travel without a safety assistant to notify you at least 48 hours in advance to provide this explanation. If the passenger fails to meet this notice requirement, however, you must still accommodate him or her to the extent practicable.

(c)(1) If you determine that a person meeting the criteria of paragraph (b)(2), (b)(3) or (b)(4) of this section must travel with a safety assistant, contrary to the individual's self-assessment that he or she is capable of traveling independently, you must not charge for the transportation of the safety assistant. You are not required to find or provide the safety assistant, however.

\(2\) For purposes of paragraph (b)(4) of this section, you may require, contrary to the individual's self-assessment, that an individual with both severe hearing and vision impairments must travel with a safety assistant if you determine that—

\(i\) The means of communication that the individual has explained to you does not adequately satisfy the objectives identified in paragraph (b)(4) of this section; or

\(ii\) The individual proposes to establish communication by means of finger spelling and you cannot, within the time following the individual's notification, arrange for a flight crew member who can communicate using this method to serve the passenger's flight.

\(3\) If a passenger voluntarily chooses to travel with a personal care attendant or safety assistant that you do not require, you may charge for the transportation of that person.

\(d\) If, because there is not a seat available on a flight for a safety assistant whom the carrier has determined to be necessary, a passenger with a disability holding a confirmed reservation is unable to travel on the flight, you must compensate the passenger with a disability in an amount to be calculated as provided for instances of involuntary denied boarding under [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0250 Oversales.md|14 CFR part 250]], where part 250 applies.

\(e\) For purposes of determining whether a seat is available for a safety assistant, you must deem the safety assistant to have checked in at the same time as the passenger with a disability.

\(f\) Concern that a passenger with a disability may need personal care services (e.g., assistance in using lavatory facilities or with eating) is not a basis for requiring the passenger to travel with a safety assistant. You must explain this clearly in training or information you provide to your employees. You may advise passengers that your personnel are not required to provide such services.

### §382.31   May carriers impose special charges on passengers with a disability for providing services and accommodations required by this rule?

\(a\) Except as otherwise provided in this part you must not, as a carrier, impose charges for providing facilities, equipment, or services that this rule requires to be provided to passengers with a disability. You may charge for services that this part does not require.

\(b\) You may charge a passenger for the use of more than one seat if the passenger's size or condition (e.g., use of a stretcher) causes him or her to occupy the space of more than one seat. This is not considered a special charge under this section.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 78 FR 67914, Nov. 12, 2013\]

### §382.33   May carriers impose other restrictions on passengers with a disability that they do not impose on other passengers?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must not subject passengers with a disability to restrictions that do not apply to other passengers, except as otherwise permitted in this part (*e.g.,* advance notice requirements for certain services permitted by [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.27   May a carrier require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice in order to obtain certain specific services in connection with a flight?|§382.27]]).

\(b\) Restrictions you must not impose on passengers with a disability include, but are not limited to, the following:

\(1\) Restricting passengers” movement within the terminal;

\(2\) Requiring passengers to remain in a holding area or other location in order to receive transportation, services, or accommodations;

\(3\) Making passengers sit on blankets on the aircraft;

\(4\) Making passengers wear badges or other special identification (*e.g.,* similar to badges worn by unaccompanied minors); or

\(5\) Otherwise mandating separate treatment for passengers with a disability, unless permitted or required by this part or other applicable Federal requirements.

### §382.35   May carriers require passengers with a disability to sign waivers or releases?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must not require passengers with a disability to sign a release or waiver of liability in order to receive transportation or to receive services or accommodations for a disability.

\(b\) You must not require passengers with a disability to sign waivers of liability for damage to or loss of wheelchairs or other assistive devices, or for the loss of, death of, or injury to service animals. Carriers may note pre-existing damage to an assistive device to the same extent that carriers do this with respect to other checked baggage.

## Subpart C—Information for Passengers

### §382.41   What flight-related information must carriers provide to qualified individuals with a disability?

As a carrier, you must provide the following information, on request, to qualified individuals with a disability or persons making inquiries on their behalf concerning the accessibility of the aircraft expected to make a particular flight. The information you provide must be specific to the aircraft you expect to use for the flight unless it is unfeasible for you to do so (*e.g.,* because unpredictable circumstances such as weather or a mechanical problem require substitution of another aircraft that could affect the location or availability of an accommodation). The required information is:

\(a\) The specific location of seats, if any, with movable armrests (*i.e.,* by row and seat number);

\(b\) The specific location of seats (*i.e.,* by row and seat number) that the carrier, consistent with this part, does not make available to passengers with a disability (*e.g.,* exit row seats);

\(c\) Any aircraft-related, service-related or other limitations on the ability to accommodate passengers with a disability, including limitations on the availability of level-entry boarding to the aircraft at any airport involved with the flight. You must provide this information to any passenger who states that he or she uses a wheelchair for boarding, even if the passenger does not explicitly request the information.

\(d\) Any limitations on the availability of storage facilities, in the cabin or in the cargo bay, for mobility aids or other assistive devices commonly used by passengers with a disability, including storage in the cabin of a passenger's wheelchair as provided in §[[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.67   What is the requirement for priority space in the cabin to store passengers' wheelchairs?|§382.67]] and 382.123 of this part;

\(e\) Whether the aircraft has an accessible lavatory; and

\(f\) The types of services to passengers with a disability that are or are not available on the flight.

### §382.43   Must information and reservation services of carriers be accessible to individuals with visual, hearing, and other disabilities?

\(a\) If, as a carrier, you provide telephone reservation and information service to the public, you must make this service available to individuals who use a text telephone (TTY), whether via your own TTY, voice relay, or other available technology, as follows:

\(1\) You must provide access to TTY users during the same hours as the telephone service is available to the general public.

\(2\) You must ensure that the response time for answering calls and the level of service provided to TTY users is substantially equivalent to the response time and level of service provided to the general public (*i.e.,* non-TTY users).

\(3\) You must not subject TTY users to charges exceeding those that apply to non-TTY users of telephone information and reservation service.

\(4\) In any medium in which you list the telephone number of your information and reservation service for the general public, you must also list your TTY number if you have one. If you do not have a TTY number, you must state how TTY users can reach your information and reservation service (*e.g.,* via a voice relay service).

\(5\) If you are a foreign carrier, you must meet this requirement by May 13, 2010.

\(b\) The requirements of paragraph (a) do not apply to you in any country in which the telecommunications infrastructure does not readily permit compliance.

\(c\) If you are a U.S. or foreign air carrier that operates at least one aircraft having a designed seating capacity of more than 60 passengers and owns or controls a primary Web site that markets passenger air transportation, or a tour (i.e., a combination of air transportation and ground or cruise accommodations), or tour component (e.g., a hotel stay) that must be purchased with air transportation, you must ensure the public-facing Web pages on your primary Web site are accessible to individuals with disabilities as provided in paragraphs (c)(1) through (4) of this section. Only Web sites that market air transportation to the general public in the United States must be accessible to individuals with disabilities. The following are among the characteristics of a primary Web site that markets to the general public in the U.S.: the content can be viewed in English, the site advertises or sells flights operating to, from, or within the United States, and the site displays fares in U.S. dollars.

\(1\) Your primary Web site must conform to all Success Criteria and all Conformance Requirements from the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Recommendation 11 December 2008, Web site Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 for Level AA as follows:

Collectively, such individuals must be able to provide feedback on the usability of the Web site by individuals with visual, auditory, tactile, and cognitive disabilities. Consultation is required to ensure that your Web site is usable by individuals with disabilities by the date specified in paragraph (c)(1).

\(3\) You are permitted to use a Level AA conforming alternate version only when conforming a public-facing Web page to all WCAG 2.0 Level AA success criteria would constitute an undue burden or fundamentally alter the information or functionality provided by that page.

\(4\) You must assist prospective passengers who indicate that they are unable to use your Web site due to a disability and contact you through other channels (e.g., by telephone or at the ticket counter) as follows:

\(i\) Disclose Web-based discount fares to the passenger if his or her itinerary qualifies for the discounted fare.

\(ii\) Provide Web-based amenities to the passenger, such as waiving any fee applicable to making a reservation or purchasing a ticket using a method other than your Web site (e.g., by telephone), unless the fee applies to other customers purchasing the same fare online.

\(d\) As a carrier covered under paragraph (c) of this section, you must provide a mechanism on your primary Web site for persons with disabilities to request disability accommodation services for future flights, including but not limited to wheelchair assistance, seating accommodation, escort assistance for a visually impaired passenger, and stowage of an assistive device no later than December 12, 2015. You may require individuals who request accommodations using this mechanism to provide contact information (e.g., name, daytime phone, evening phone, and email address) for follow-up by your customer service department or medical desk.

\(e\) As a carrier covered under paragraph (c) of this section, you must provide a disclaimer activated when a user clicks a link on your primary Web site to an external Web site or to third-party software informing the user that the Web site or software may not follow the same accessibility policies no later than December 12, 2016.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11471, Mar. 18, 2009; 78 FR 67914, Nov. 12, 2013\]

### §382.45   Must carriers make copies of this Part available to passengers?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must keep a current copy of this part at each airport you serve. As a foreign carrier, you must keep a copy of this part at each airport serving a flight you operate that begins or ends at a U.S. airport. You must make this copy available for review by any member of the public on request.

\(b\) If you have a Web site, it must provide notice to consumers that they can obtain a copy of this part in an accessible format from the Department of Transportation by any of the following means:

\(1\) For calls made from within the United States, by telephone via the Toll-Free Hotline for Air Travelers with Disabilities at 1-800-778-4838 (voice) or 1-800-455-9880 (TTY),

\(2\) By telephone to the Aviation Consumer Protection Division at 202-366-2220 (voice) or 202-366-0511 (TTY),

## Subpart D—Accessibility of Airport Facilities

### §382.51   What requirements must carriers meet concerning the accessibility of airport facilities?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must comply with the following requirements with respect to all terminal facilities you own, lease, or control at a U.S. airport:

\(1\) You must ensure that terminal facilities providing access to air transportation are readily accessible to and usable by individuals with disabilities, including individuals who use wheelchairs. You are deemed to comply with this obligation if the facilities meet requirements applying to places of public accommodation under Department of Justice (DOJ) regulations implementing Title III of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).

\(2\) With respect to any situation in which boarding and deplaning by level-entry loading bridges or accessible passenger lounges to and from an aircraft is not available, you must ensure that there is an accessible route between the gate and the area from which aircraft are boarded (*e.g.*, the tarmac in a situation in which level-entry boarding is not available). An accessible route is one meeting the requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act Accessibility Guidelines (ADAAG), sections 4.3.3 through 4.3.10.

\(3\) You must ensure that systems of intra- and inter-terminal transportation, including, but not limited to, moving sidewalks, shuttle vehicles and people movers, comply with applicable requirements of the Department of Transportation's ADA rules (49 CFR parts 37 and 38).

\(4\) Your contracts or leases with airport operators concerning the use of airport facilities must set forth your airport accessibility responsibility under this part and that of the airport operator under applicable section 504 and ADA rules of the Department of Transportation and Department of Justice.

\(5\) In cooperation with the airport operator and in consultation with local service animal training organization(s), you must provide animal relief areas for service animals that accompany passengers departing, connecting, or arriving at an airport on your flights.

\(6\) You must enable captioning at all times on all televisions and other audio-visual displays that are capable of displaying captions and that are located in any portion of the terminal to which any passengers have access on May 13, 2009. The captioning must be high-contrast insofar as is feasible.

\(7\) You must replace any televisions and other audio-visual displays providing passengers with safety briefings, information, or entertainment that do not have high-contrast captioning capability with equipment that does have such capability whenever such equipment is replaced in the normal course of operations and/or whenever areas of the terminal in which such equipment is located are undergoing substantial renovation or expansion.

\(8\) If you newly acquire televisions and other audio-visual displays for passenger safety briefings, information, or entertainment on or after May 13, 2009, such equipment must have high-contrast captioning capability.

\(b\) As a carrier, you must ensure that passengers with a disability can readily use all terminal facilities you own, lease, or control at a foreign airport. In the case of foreign carriers, this requirement applies only to terminal facilities that serve flights covered by [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.7   To whom do the provisions of this part apply?|§382.7]] of this part.

\(1\) This means that passengers with a disability must be able to move readily through such terminal facilities to get to or from the gate and any other area from which passengers board the aircraft you use for such flights (*e.g.*, the tarmac in the case of flights that do not use level-entry boarding). This obligation is in addition to your obligation to provide enplaning, deplaning, and connecting assistance to passengers.

\(2\) You may meet this obligation through any combination of facility accessibility, auxiliary aids, equipment, the assistance of personnel, or other appropriate means consistent with the safety and dignity of passengers with a disability.

\(c\) As a foreign carrier, you must meet the requirements of this section by May 13, 2010, except as otherwise indicated in paragraph (a). As a U.S. carrier, you must meet the requirements of paragraph (b) of this section by May 13, 2010.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11471, Mar. 18, 2009; 75 FR 44887, July 30, 2010\]

### §382.53   What information must carriers give individuals with a vision or hearing impairment at airports?

(a)(1) As a U.S. carrier, you must ensure that passengers with a disability who identify themselves as persons needing visual or hearing assistance have prompt access to the same information provided to other passengers at each gate, ticketing area, and customer service desk that you own, lease, or control at any U.S. or foreign airport, to the extent that this does not interfere with employees' safety and security duties as set forth in FAA, TSA, and applicable foreign regulations.

\(2\) As a foreign carrier, you must make this information available at each gate, ticketing area, and customer service desk that you own, lease, or control at any U.S. airport. At foreign airports, you must make this information available only at gates, ticketing areas, or customer service desks that you own, lease, or control and only for flights that begin or end in the U.S.

\(3\) As a U.S. or foreign carrier, at any U.S. airport covered by this paragraph where the airport has effective control over the covered gates, ticketing areas, and customer service desks, you and the airport are jointly responsible for compliance.

\(b\) The information you must provide under paragraph (a) of this section includes, but is not limited to, the following: Information concerning flight safety, ticketing, flight check-in, flight delays or cancellations, schedule changes, boarding information, connections, gate assignments, checking baggage, volunteer solicitation on oversold flights (*e.g.*, offers of compensation for surrendering a reservation), individuals being paged by airlines, aircraft changes that affect the travel of persons with disabilities, and emergencies (*e.g.*, fire, bomb threat).

\(c\) With respect to information on claiming baggage, you must provide the information to passengers who identify themselves as persons needing visual or hearing assistance no later than you provide this information to other passengers.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11471, Mar. 18, 2009\]

### §382.55   May carriers impose security screening procedures for passengers with disabilities that go beyond TSA requirements or those of foreign governments?

\(a\) All passengers, including those with disabilities, are subject to TSA security screening requirements at U.S. airports. In addition, passengers at foreign airports, including those with disabilities, may be subject to security screening measures required by law of the country in which the airport is located.

\(b\) If, as a carrier, you impose security screening procedures for passengers with disabilities that go beyond those mandated by TSA (or, at a foreign airport, beyond the law of the country in which the airport is located), you must ensure that they meet the following requirements:

\(1\) You must use the same criteria for applying security screening procedures to passengers with disabilities as to other passengers.

\(2\) You must not subject a passenger with a disability to special screening procedures because the person is traveling with a mobility aid or other assistive device if the person using the aid or device clears the security system without activating it.

\(i\) However, your security personnel may examine a mobility aid or assistive device which, in their judgment, may conceal a weapon or other prohibited item.

\(ii\) You may conduct security searches of qualified individuals with a disability whose aids activate the security system in the same manner as for other passengers.

\(3\) You must not require private security screenings of passengers with a disability to a greater extent, or for any different reason, than for other passengers.

\(c\) Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, if a passenger with a disability requests a private screening in a timely manner, you must provide it in time for the passenger to enplane.

\(d\) If you use technology that can conduct an appropriate screening of a passenger with a disability without necessitating a physical search of the person, you are not required to provide a private screening.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11471, Mar. 18, 2009\]

### §382.57   What accessibility requirements apply to automated airport kiosks?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must comply with the following requirements with respect to any automated airport kiosk you own, lease, or control at a U.S. airport with 10,000 or more enplanements per year.

\(1\) You must ensure that all automated airport kiosks installed on or after December 12, 2016, are models that meet the design specifications set forth in paragraph (c) of this section until at least 25 percent of automated kiosks provided in each location at the airport (i.e., each cluster of kiosks and all stand-alone kiosks at the airport) meets this specification.

\(2\) You must ensure that at least 25 percent of automated kiosks you own, lease, or control in each location at a U.S. airport meet the design specifications in paragraph (c) of this section by December 12, 2022.

\(3\) When the kiosks provided in a location at the airport perform more than one function (e.g., print boarding passes/bag tags, accept payment for flight amenities such as seating upgrades/meals/WiFi access, rebook tickets, etc.), you must ensure that the accessible kiosks provide all the same functions as the inaccessible kiosks in that location.

\(4\) You must ensure that a passenger with a disability who requests an accessible automated kiosk is given priority access to any available accessible kiosk you own, lease, or control in that location at the airport.

\(5\) You must ensure that each automated airport kiosk that meets the design specifications in paragraph (c) of this section is:

\(i\) Visually and tactilely identifiable to users as accessible (e.g., an international symbol of accessibility affixed to the front of the device).

\(ii\) Maintained in proper working condition.

\[78 FR 67915, Nov. 12, 2013\]

## Subpart E—Accessibility of Aircraft and Service Animals on Aircraft

### §382.61   What are the requirements for movable aisle armrests?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must ensure that aircraft with 30 or more passenger seats on which passenger aisle seats have armrests are equipped with movable aisle armrests on at least one-half of the aisle seats in rows in which passengers with mobility impairments are permitted to sit under FAA or applicable foreign government safety rules.

\(b\) You are not required to provide movable armrests on aisle seats of rows which a passenger with a mobility impairment is precluded from using by an FAA safety rule.

\(c\) You must ensure that these movable aisle armrests are provided proportionately in all classes of service in the cabin. For example, if 80 percent of the aisle seats in which passengers with mobility impairments may sit are in coach, and 20 percent are in first class, then 80 percent of the movable aisle armrests must be in coach, with 20 percent in first class.

\(d\) For aircraft equipped with movable aisle armrests, you must configure cabins, or establish administrative systems, to ensure that passengers with mobility impairments or other passengers with a disability can readily identify and obtain seating in rows with movable aisle armrests. You must provide this information by specific seat and row number.

\(e\) You are not required to retrofit cabin interiors of existing aircraft to comply with the requirements of this section. However, if you replace any of an aircraft's aisle seats with newly manufactured seats, the new seats must include movable aisle armrests as required by this section. However, an aircraft is never required to have movable aisle armrests on more than one half of the aisle seats.

\(f\) As a foreign carrier, you must comply with the requirements of paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after May 13, 2009 or which are delivered after May 13, 2010. As a U.S. carrier, the requirements of paragraphs (a), (b), (d), and (e) of this section applies to you with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after April 5, 1990, or which are delivered after April 5, 1992. As a U.S. carrier, paragraph (c) of this section applies to you with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after May 13, 2009 or which were delivered after May 13, 2010.

\(g\) As a foreign carrier, you must comply with the requirements of paragraph (e) of this section with respect to seats ordered after May 13, 2009.

### §382.63   What are the requirements for accessible lavatories?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must ensure that aircraft with more than one aisle in which lavatories are provided shall include at least one accessible lavatory.

\(1\) The accessible lavatory must permit a qualified individual with a disability to enter, maneuver within as necessary to use all lavatory facilities, and leave, by means of the aircraft's on-board wheelchair.

\(2\) The accessible lavatory must afford privacy to persons using the on-board wheelchair equivalent to that afforded ambulatory users.

\(3\) The lavatory shall provide door locks, accessible call buttons, grab bars, faucets and other controls, and dispensers usable by qualified individuals with a disability, including wheelchair users and persons with manual impairments.

\(b\) With respect to aircraft with only one aisle in which lavatories are provided, you may, but are not required to, provide an accessible lavatory.

\(c\) You are not required to retrofit cabin interiors of existing aircraft to comply with the requirements of this section. However, if you replace a lavatory on an aircraft with more than one aisle, you must replace it with an accessible lavatory.

\(d\) As a foreign carrier, you must comply with the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after May 13, 2009 or which are delivered after May 13, 2010. As a U.S. carrier, this requirement applies to you with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after April 5, 1990, or which were delivered after April 5, 1992.

\(e\) As a foreign carrier, you must comply with the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section beginning May 13, 2009. As a U.S. carrier, these requirements apply to you with respect to new aircraft you operate that were initially ordered after April 5, 1990, or which were delivered after April 5, 1992.

### §382.65   What are the requirements concerning on-board wheelchairs?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must equip aircraft that have more than 60 passenger seats, and that have an accessible lavatory (whether or not having such a lavatory is required by [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.63   What are the requirements for accessible lavatories?|§382.63]] of this Part) with an on-board wheelchair. The Aerospatiale/Aeritalia ATR-72 and the British Aerospace Advanced Turboprop (ATP), in configurations having between 60 and 70 passenger seats, are exempt from this requirement.

\(b\) If a passenger asks you to provide an on-board wheelchair on a particular flight, you must provide it if the aircraft being used for the flight has more than 60 passenger seats, even if the aircraft does not have an accessible lavatory.

\(1\) The basis of the passenger's request must be that he or she can use an inaccessible lavatory but cannot reach it from a seat without using an on-board wheelchair.

\(2\) You may require the passenger to provide the advance notice specified in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.27   May a carrier require a passenger with a disability to provide advance notice in order to obtain certain specific services in connection with a flight?|§382.27]] to receive this service.

\(c\) You must ensure that on-board wheelchairs meet the following standards:

\(1\) On-board wheelchairs must include footrests, armrests which are movable or removable, adequate occupant restraint systems, a backrest height that permits assistance to passengers in transferring, structurally sound handles for maneuvering the occupied chair, and wheel locks or another adequate means to prevent chair movement during transfer or turbulence.

\(2\) The chair must be designed to be compatible with the maneuvering space, aisle width, and seat height of the aircraft on which it is to be used, and to be easily pushed, pulled, and turned in the cabin environment by carrier personnel.

\(d\) As a foreign carrier, you must meet this requirement as of May 13, 2010. As a U.S. carrier, you must meet this requirement by May 13, 2009.

### §382.67   What is the requirement for priority space in the cabin to store passengers' wheelchairs?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must ensure that there is priority space (i.e., a closet, or a row of seats where a wheelchair may be strapped using a strap kit that complies with applicable Federal Aviation Administration or applicable foreign government regulations on the stowage of cargo in the cabin compartment) in the cabin of sufficient size to stow at least one typical adult-sized folding, collapsible, or break-down manual passenger wheelchair, the dimensions of which are 13 inches by 36 inches by 42 inches or less without having to remove the wheels or otherwise disassemble it. This section applies to any aircraft with 100 or more passenger seats and this space must be other than the overhead compartments and under-seat spaces routinely used for passengers' carry-on items.

\(b\) If you are a carrier that uses the seat-strapping method to stow a manual passenger wheelchair, you must ensure that there is priority space for at least two such wheelchairs, if stowing the second passenger wheelchair would not displace passengers.

\(c\) If you are a carrier that uses a closet as the priority space to stow a manual passenger wheelchair, you must install a sign or placard prominently on the closet indicating that such wheelchairs and other assistive devices are to be stowed in this area with priority over other items brought onto the aircraft by other passengers or crew, including crew luggage, as set forth in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.123   What are the requirements concerning priority cabin stowage for wheelchairs and other assistive devices?|§382.123]].

\(d\) If passengers holding confirmed reservations are not able to travel on a flight because their seats are being used to stow a passenger's wheelchair as required by paragraph (a) of this section, carriers must compensate those passengers in an amount to be calculated as provided for in instances of involuntary denied boarding under [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0250 Oversales.md|14 CFR part 250]], where part 250 applies.

\(e\) As a carrier, you must never request or suggest that a passenger not stow his or her wheelchair in the cabin to accommodate other passengers (e.g., informing a passenger that stowing his or her wheelchair in the cabin will require other passengers to be removed from the flight), or for any other non-safety related reason (e.g., that it is easier for the carrier if the wheelchair is stowed in the cargo compartment).

\(f\) As a carrier, you must offer pre-boarding to a passenger stowing his or her wheelchair in the cabin.

\(g\) As a foreign carrier, you must meet the requirement of this section for new aircraft ordered after May 13, 2009, or delivered after May 13, 2010. As a U.S. carrier, this section applies to you with respect to new aircraft you operate that were ordered after April 5, 1990, or which were delivered after April 5, 1992.

\[78 FR 67923, Nov. 12, 2013\]

### §382.69   What requirements must carriers meet concerning the accessibility of videos, DVDs, and other audio-visual presentations shown on-aircraft to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must ensure that all new videos, DVDs, and other audio-visual displays played on aircraft for safety purposes, and all such new audio-visual displays played on aircraft for informational purposes that were created under your control, are high-contrast captioned. The captioning must be in the predominant language or languages in which you communicate with passengers on the flight.

\(b\) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section go into effect with respect to audio-visual displays used for safety purposes on November 10, 2009.

\(c\) Between May 13, 2009 and November 9, 2009, U.S. carriers must ensure that all videos, DVDs, and other audio-visual displays played on aircraft for safety purposes have open captioning or an inset for a sign language interpreter, unless such captioning or inset either would interfere with the video presentation so as to render it ineffective or would not be large enough to be readable, in which case these carriers must use an equivalent non-video alternative for transmitting the briefing to passengers with hearing impairments.

\(d\) The requirements of paragraph (a) of this section go into effect with respect to informational displays on January 8, 2010.

### §382.71   What other aircraft accessibility requirements apply to carriers?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must maintain all aircraft accessibility features in proper working order.

\(b\) You must ensure that any replacement or refurbishing of the aircraft cabin or its elements does not reduce the accessibility of that element to a level below that specified for new aircraft in this part.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11471, Mar. 18, 2009\]SECTION\>

§382.72Must carriers allow a service animal to accompany a passenger with a disability?

You must allow a service animal to accompany a passenger with a disability. You must not deny transportation to a service animal based on the animal's breed or type or on the basis that its carriage may offend or annoy carrier personnel or persons traveling on the aircraft.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020\]

### §382.73   How do carriers determine if an animal is a service animal that must be accepted for transport? May a carrier require that a service animal be under the control of the service animal user or handler?

\(a\) You may rely on one or more of the factors set forth in paragraphs (a)(1) through)(3) of this section to determine if an animal is a service animal that must be accepted for transport.

\(1\) You may make two inquiries to determine whether an animal qualifies as a service animal. You may ask if the animal is required to accompany the passenger because of a disability and what work or task the animal has been trained to perform. You must not ask about the nature or extent of a person's disability or ask that the service animal demonstrate its work or task.

\(2\) You may observe the behavior of an animal. A trained service animal will remain under the control of its handler. It does not run freely around an aircraft or an airport gate area, bark or growl repeatedly at other persons or other animals on the aircraft or in the airport gate area, bite, jump on, or cause injury to people, or urinate or defecate in the cabin or gate area. An animal that engages in such disruptive behavior demonstrates that it has not been successfully trained to behave properly in a public setting and carriers are not required to treat it as a service animal without a carrier in the cabin, even if the animal performs an assistive function for a passenger with a disability.

\(3\) You may look for physical indicators, such as a harness or vest on the animal, to determine if the animal is a service animal.

\(b\) You may require that a service animal be harnessed, leashed, or otherwise tethered at all times by the service animal user or service animal handler while in areas of the airport that you own, lease or control, or on an aircraft.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020\]

### §382.74   How many service animals must a carrier transport in the cabin of aircraft?

You are not required to accept more than two service animals for a single passenger with a disability.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020\]

### §382.75   May a carrier require documentation from passengers with disabilities seeking to travel with a service animal?

\(a\) If a passenger with a disability seeks to travel with a service animal, you may require the passenger to provide you, as a condition of permitting the service animal to travel in the cabin, a current completed U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Air Transportation Form. Current means the form was completed on or after the date the passenger purchased his or her airline ticket.

\(b\) On a flight segment scheduled to take 8 hours or more, you may, as a condition of permitting a service animal to travel in the cabin, require the passenger with a disability traveling with the service animal to confirm that the animal will not need to relieve itself on the flight, or that the animal can relieve itself in a way that does not create a health or sanitation issue on the flight by providing a current DOT Service Animal Relief Attestation Form. Current means the form was completed on or after the date the passenger purchased his or her airline ticket.

\(c\) You are not permitted to require documentation from passengers with disabilities traveling with service animals beyond the completion of the forms identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section except to comply with requirements on transport of animals by a Federal agency, a U.S. territory or a foreign jurisdiction.

\(d\) As a U.S. air carrier, if you require service animal users to submit the forms identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, you must have copies of these forms available for passengers at each airport you serve. As a foreign air carrier, if you require service animal users to submit the forms identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, you must have copies of the forms available for passengers at each airport serving a flight you operate that begins or ends at a U.S. airport.

\(e\) If you have a website, you must have the forms identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) available to passengers in an accessible format. You must mail copies of the forms identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) to passengers upon request.

\(f\) If you require a passenger with a disability traveling with a service animal to submit the forms identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section in advance of the passenger's date of travel, you must provide the passenger the option of submitting the completed form(s) to you electronically or by hardcopy.

(g)(1) If a passenger's reservation was made more than 48 hours in advance of the first originally scheduled departure time on the passenger's itinerary, you may require that passenger provide up to 48 hours advance notice by submitting the form identified in paragraph (a) of this section.

\(2\) If a passenger's reservation was made more than 48 hours in advance of the first originally scheduled departure time on the passenger's itinerary and a flight segment on the passenger's itinerary is scheduled to take 8 hours or more, you may require that the passenger provide up to 48 hours advance notice by submitting the form identified in paragraph (b) of this section.

\(3\) If a passenger's reservation was made less than 48 hours in advance of the first originally scheduled departure time on the passenger's itinerary, you may not require that passenger provide advance notice of his or her intent to travel with a service animal. You may require that the passenger complete the forms identified in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section and submit a copy of the form to you at the passenger's departure gate on the date of travel.

\(h\) If the passenger does not meet the advance notice requirements you establish consistent with this section, you must still provide the accommodation if you can do so by making reasonable efforts, without delaying the flight.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020\]

### §382.76   May a carrier require a service animal user to check-in physically at the airport?

You may not require a passenger with a disability to check-in physically at the airport, rather than using the online check-in available to the general public, on the basis that the passenger is traveling with a service animal.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020\]

### §382.77   May carriers restrict the location and placement of service animals on aircraft?

\(a\) You must permit a service animal to accompany a passenger with a disability on the passenger's lap or in the passenger's foot space, unless this location and placement would:

\(1\) Be inconsistent with safety requirements set by the FAA or the foreign carrier's government; or

\(2\) Encroach into another passenger's space.

\(b\) Before refusing to transport a large service animal that cannot be accommodated on the passenger's lap or in the passenger's foot space without encroaching into another passenger's space, you must offer the passenger the opportunity to move with the animal to another seat location within the same class of service, if available on the aircraft, where the animal can be accommodated. You are not required to reseat other passengers to accommodate a service animal except as required for designated priority seats in Subpart F.

\(c\) If there are no alternatives available to enable the passenger to travel with the service animal in the cabin of the scheduled flight, you must offer the passenger the opportunity to transport the service animal in the cargo hold free of charge or travel on a later flight to the extent there is space available on a later flight and the transport is consistent with the safety requirements set by the FAA or a foreign carrier's government.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020\]

### §382.78   May carriers charge individuals with disabilities for the damage their service animal causes?

While you generally cannot charge an individual with a disability for transporting service animals, or for providing other services that this part requires, you may charge a passenger with a disability for damage caused by his or her service animal so long as you normally charge individuals without disabilities for similar kinds of damage.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2018-0068, 85 FR 79774, Dec. 10, 2020\]

### §382.79   Under what other circumstances may carriers refuse to provide transportation to a service animal traveling with a passenger with a disability?

\(a\) You may deny transport to a service animal under the following circumstances:

\(1\) The animal poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others (see definition in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.3   What do the terms in this rule mean?|§382.3]]);

\(2\) The animal causes a significant disruption in the cabin or at an airport gate area, or its behavior on the aircraft or at an airport gate area indicates that it has not been trained to behave properly in public (e.g., running freely, barking or growling repeatedly at other persons on the aircraft, biting or jumping on people, or urinating or defecating in the cabin or gate area);

\(3\) The animal's carriage would violate applicable safety or health requirements of any U.S. federal agency, U.S. territory or foreign government; or

\(4\) The passenger with a disability seeking to travel with a service animal in the cabin of the aircraft does not provide completed current forms as set forth in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.75   May a carrier require documentation from passengers with disabilities seeking to travel with a service animal?|§382.75]] (a) and (b) to the carrier when requested to do so.

\(b\) In determining whether to deny transport to a service animal on the basis that the animal poses a direct threat under paragraph (a)(1) of this section, you must make an individualized assessment, independent of the dog's breed or type, based on reasonable judgment that relies on the best available objective evidence to ascertain the nature, duration, and severity of the risk; the probability that the potential injury will actually occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedure will mitigate the risk. A current completed U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Air Transportation Form may be used in making this determination.

\(c\) In determining whether to deny transport to a service animal on the basis that the animal has misbehaved and/or has caused a significant disruption in the cabin under paragraph (a)(2) of this section, you must make an individualized assessment, independent of the dog's breed or type, based on reasonable judgment that relies on the best available objective evidence to ascertain the probability that the misbehavior and/or disruption will continue to occur; and whether reasonable modifications of policies, practices, or procedure will mitigate the misbehavior and/or the disruption. A current completed U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Air Transportation Form and a current completed U.S. Department of Transportation Service Animal Relief Attestation Form may be used in making this determination.

\(d\) In conducting the analysis required under paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this section, you must not deny transportation to the service animal if there are means available short of refusal that would mitigate the problem (e.g., muzzling a barking service dog or taking other steps to comply with animal health regulations needed to permit entry of the service animal into a domestic territory or a foreign country).

\(e\) If you refuse to provide transportation to a service animal based on any provision in this part, you must provide the individual with a disability accompanied by the service animal a written statement of the reason for the refusal. This statement must include the specific basis for the carrier's opinion that the refusal meets the standards of paragraphs (a) through (c) of this section or is otherwise specifically permitted by this part.

## Subpart F—Seating Accommodations

### §382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?

As a carrier, you must provide the following seating accommodations to the following passengers on request, if the passenger self-identifies to you as having a disability specified in this section and the type of seating accommodation in question exists on the particular aircraft. Once the passenger self-identifies to you, you must ensure that the information is recorded and properly transmitted to personnel responsible for providing the accommodation.

\(a\) For a passenger who uses an aisle chair to access the aircraft and who cannot readily transfer over a fixed aisle armrest, you must provide a seat in a row with a movable aisle armrest. You must ensure that your personnel are trained in the location and proper use of movable aisle armrests, including appropriate transfer techniques. You must ensure that aisle seats with movable armrests are clearly identifiable.

\(b\) You must provide an adjoining seat for a person assisting a passenger with a disability in the following circumstances:

\(1\) When a passenger with a disability is traveling with a personal care attendant who will be performing a function for the individual during the flight that airline personnel are not required to perform (*e.g.,* assistance with eating);

\(2\) When a passenger with a vision impairment is traveling with a reader/assistant who will be performing functions for the individual during the flight;

\(3\) When a passenger with a hearing impairment is traveling with an interpreter who will be performing functions for the individual during the flight; or

\(4\) When you require a passenger to travel with a safety assistant (see [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.29   May a carrier require a passenger with a disability to travel with a safety assistant?|§382.29]]).

\(c\) For a passenger with a disability traveling with a service animal, you must provide, as the passenger requests, either a bulkhead seat or a seat other than a bulkhead seat.

\(d\) For a passenger with a fused or immobilized leg, you must provide a bulkhead seat or other seat that provides greater legroom than other seats, on the side of an aisle that better accommodates the individual's disability.

### §382.83   Through what mechanisms do carriers make seating accommodations?

\(a\) If you are a carrier that provides advance seat assignments to passengers (*i.e.,* offer seat assignments to passengers before the day of the flight), you must comply with the requirements of [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.81]] of this part by any of the following methods:

\(1\) You may “block” an adequate number of the seats used to provide the seating accommodations required by [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.81]].

\(i\) You must not assign these seats to passengers who do not meet the criteria of [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.81]] until 24 hours before the scheduled departure of the flight.

\(ii\) At any time up until 24 hours before the scheduled departure of the flight, you must assign a seat meeting the requirements of this section to a passenger with a disability meeting one or more of the requirements of [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.81]] who requests it, at the time the passenger initially makes the request.

\(iii\) If a passenger with a disability specified in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.81]] does not make a request at least 24 hours before the scheduled departure of the flight, you must meet the passenger's request to the extent practicable, but you are not required to reassign a seat assigned to another passenger in order to do so.

\(2\) You may designate an adequate number of the seats used to provide seating accommodations required by [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.81]] as “priority seats” for passengers with a disability.

\(i\) You must provide notice that all passengers assigned these seats (other than passengers with a disability listed in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.81]] of this part) are subject to being reassigned to another seat if necessary to provide a seating accommodation required by this section.

\(ii\) You may provide this notice through your computer reservation system, verbal information provided by reservation personnel, ticket notices, gate announcements, counter signs, seat cards or notices, frequent-flier literature, or other appropriate means.

\(iii\) You must assign a seat meeting the requirements of this section to a passenger with a disability listed in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.81]] of this part who requests the accommodation at the time the passenger makes the request. You may require such a passenger to check in and request the seating accommodation at least one hour before the standard check-in time for the flight. If all designated priority seats that would accommodate the passenger have been assigned to other passengers, you must reassign the seats of the other passengers as needed to provide the requested accommodation.

\(iv\) If a passenger with a disability listed in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.81]] does not check in at least an hour before the standard check-in time for the general public, you must meet the individual's request to the extent practicable, but you are not required to reassign a seat assigned to another passenger in order to do so.

\(b\) If you assign seats to passengers, but not until the date of the flight, you must use the “priority seating” approach of paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

\(c\) If you do not provide advance seat assignments to passengers, you must allow passengers specified in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.81]] to board the aircraft before other passengers, including other “preboarded” passengers, so that the passengers needing seating accommodations can select seats that best meet their needs.

\(d\) As a carrier, if you wish to use a different method of providing seating assignment accommodations to passengers with disabilities from those specified in this subpart, you must obtain the written concurrence of the Department of Transportation. Contact the Department at the address cited in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.159   How are complaints filed with DOT?|§382.159]] of this part.

### §382.85   What seating accommodations must carriers make to passengers in circumstances not covered by [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.81]] (a) through (d)?

As a carrier, you must provide the following seating accommodations to a passenger who self-identifies as having a disability other than one in the four categories listed in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.81]] (a) through (d) of this part and as needing a seat assignment accommodation in order to readily access and use the carrier's air transportation services:

\(a\) As a carrier that assigns seats in advance, you must provide accommodations in the following ways:

\(1\) If you use the “seat-blocking” mechanism of [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.83   Through what mechanisms do carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.83]](a)(1) of this part, you must implement the requirements of this section as follows:

\(i\) When a passenger with a disability not described in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.81]](a) through (d) of this part makes a reservation more than 24 hours before the scheduled departure time of the flight, you are not required to offer the passenger one of the seats blocked for the use of passengers with a disability listed under [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.81]].

\(ii\) However, you must assign to the passenger any seat, not already assigned to another passenger that accommodates the passenger's needs, even if that seat is not available for assignment to the general passenger population at the time of the request.

\(i\) When a passenger with a disability not described in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.81   For which passengers must carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.81]] makes a reservation, you must assign to the passenger any seat, not already assigned to another passenger, that accommodates the passenger's needs, even if that seat is not available for assignment to the general passenger population at the time of the request. You may require a passenger making such a request to check in one hour before the standard check-in time for the flight.

\(ii\) If such a passenger is assigned to a designated priority seat, he or she is subject to being reassigned to another seat as provided in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.83   Through what mechanisms do carriers make seating accommodations?|§382.83]](a)(2)(i) of this subpart.

\(b\) On flights where advance seat assignments are not offered, you must provide seating accommodations under this section by allowing passengers to board the aircraft before other passengers, including other “preboarded” passengers, so that the individuals needing seating accommodations can select seats that best meet their needs.

\(c\) If you assign seats to passengers, but not until the date of the flight, you must use the “priority seating” approach of section 382.83(a)(2).

### §382.87   What other requirements pertain to seating for passengers with a disability?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must not exclude any passenger with a disability from any seat or require that a passenger with a disability sit in any particular seat, on the basis of disability, except to comply with FAA or applicable foreign government safety requirements.

## Subpart G—Boarding, Deplaning, and Connecting Assistance

### §382.91   What assistance must carriers provide to passengers with a disability in moving within the terminal?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must provide or ensure the provision of assistance requested by or on behalf of a passenger with a disability, or offered by carrier or airport operator personnel and accepted by a passenger with a disability, in transportation between gates to make a connection to another flight. If the arriving flight and the departing connecting flight are operated by different carriers, the carrier that operated the arriving flight (*i.e.,* the one that operates the first of the two flights that are connecting) is responsible for providing or ensuring the provision of this assistance, even if the passenger holds a separate ticket for the departing flight. It is permissible for the two carriers to mutually agree that the carrier operating the departing connecting flight (*i.e.,* the second flight of the two) will provide this assistance, but the carrier operating the arriving flight remains responsible under this section for ensuring that the assistance is provided.

\(b\) You must also provide or ensure the provision of assistance requested by or on behalf of a passenger with a disability, or offered by carrier or airport operator personnel and accepted by a passenger with a disability, in moving from the terminal entrance (or a vehicle drop-off point adjacent to the entrance) through the airport to the gate for a departing flight, or from the gate to the terminal entrance (or a vehicle pick-up point adjacent to the entrance after an arriving flight).

\(1\) This requirement includes assistance in accessing key functional areas of the terminal, such as ticket counters and baggage claim.

\(2\) This requirement also includes a brief stop upon the passenger's request at the entrance to a rest room (including an accessible rest room when requested). As a carrier, you are required to make such a stop only if the rest room is available on the route to the destination of the enplaning, deplaning, or connecting assistance and you can make the stop without unreasonable delay. To receive such assistance, the passenger must self-identify as being an individual with a disability needing the assistance.

\(c\) As a carrier at a U.S. airport, you must, on request, in cooperation with the airport operator, provide for escorting a passenger with a service animal to an animal relief area provided under [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.51   What requirements must carriers meet concerning the accessibility of airport facilities?|§382.51]](a)(5) of this part.

\(d\) As part of your obligation to provide or ensure the provision of assistance to passengers with disabilities in moving through the terminal (*e.g.,* between the terminal entrance and the gate, between gate and aircraft, from gate to a baggage claim area), you must assist passengers who are unable to carry their luggage because of a disability with transporting their gate-checked or carry-on luggage. You may request the credible verbal assurance that a passenger cannot carry the luggage in question. If a passenger is unable to provide credible assurance, you may require the passenger to provide documentation as a condition of providing this service.

### §382.93   Must carriers offer preboarding to passengers with a disability?

As a carrier, you must offer preboarding to passengers with a disability who self-identify at the gate as needing additional time or assistance to board, stow accessibility equipment, or be seated.

### §382.95   What are carriers' general obligations with respect to boarding and deplaning assistance?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must promptly provide or ensure the provision of assistance requested by or on behalf of passengers with a disability, or offered by carrier or airport operator personnel and accepted by passengers with a disability, in enplaning and deplaning. This assistance must include, as needed, the services of personnel and the use of ground wheelchairs, accessible motorized carts, boarding wheelchairs, and/or on-board wheelchairs where provided in accordance with this part, and ramps or mechanical lifts.

\(b\) As a carrier, you must, except as otherwise provided in this subpart, provide boarding and deplaning assistance through the use of lifts or ramps at any U.S. commercial service airport with 10,000 or more annual enplanements where boarding and deplaning by level-entry loading bridges or accessible passenger lounges is not available.

### §382.97   To which aircraft does the requirement to provide boarding and deplaning assistance through the use of lifts apply?

The requirement of section 382.95(b) of this part to provide boarding and deplaning assistance through the use of lifts applies with respect to all aircraft with a passenger capacity of 19 or more, with the following exceptions:

\(a\) Float planes;

\(b\) The following 19-seat capacity aircraft models: the Fairchild Metro, the Jetstream 31 and 32, the Beech 1900 (C and D models), and the Embraer EMB-120;

\(c\) Any other aircraft model determined by the Department of Transportation to be unsuitable for boarding and deplaning assistance by lift, ramp, or other suitable device.

The Department will make such a determination if it concludes that—

\(1\) No existing boarding and deplaning assistance device on the market will accommodate the aircraft without a significant risk of serious damage to the aircraft or injury to passengers or employees, or

\(2\) Internal barriers are present in the aircraft that would preclude passengers who use a boarding or aisle chair from reaching a non-exit row seat.

### §382.99   What agreements must carriers have with the airports they serve?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must negotiate in good faith with the airport operator of each U.S. airport described in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.95   What are carriers' general obligations with respect to boarding and deplaning assistance?|§382.95]](b) to ensure the provision of lifts for boarding and deplaning where level-entry loading bridges are not available.

\(b\) You must have a written, signed agreement with the airport operator allocating responsibility for meeting the boarding and deplaning assistance requirements of this subpart between or among the parties. For foreign carriers, with respect to all covered aircraft, this requirement becomes effective May 13, 2010.

\(c\) For foreign carriers, the agreement with a U.S. airport must provide that all actions necessary to ensure accessible boarding and deplaning for passengers with a disability are completed as soon as practicable, but no later than May 13, 2011.

\(d\) Under the agreement, you may, as a carrier, require that passengers wishing to receive boarding and deplaning assistance requiring the use of a lift for a flight check in for the flight one hour before the standard check-in time for the flight. If the passenger checks in after this time, you must nonetheless provide the boarding and deplaning assistance by lift if you can do so by making a reasonable effort, without delaying the flight.

\(e\) The agreement must ensure that all lifts and other accessibility equipment are maintained in proper working condition.

\(f\) All carriers and airport operators involved are jointly and severally responsible for the timely and complete implementation of the agreement.

\(g\) You must make a copy of this agreement available, on request, to representatives of the Department of Transportation.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2004-19482, 73 FR 27665, May 13, 2008, as amended at 74 FR 11471, Mar. 18, 2009\]

### §382.101   What other boarding and deplaning assistance must carriers provide?

When level-entry boarding and deplaning assistance is not required to be provided under this subpart, you must, as a carrier, provide or ensure the provision of boarding and deplaning assistance by any available means to which the passenger consents. However, you must never use hand-carrying (*i.e.,* directly picking up the passenger's body in the arms of one or more carrier personnel to effect a level change the passenger needs to enter or leave the aircraft), even if the passenger consents, unless this is the only way of evacuating the individual in the event of an emergency. The situations in which level-entry boarding is not required but in which you must provide this boarding and deplaning assistance include, but are not limited to, the following:

\(a\) The boarding or deplaning process occurs at a U.S. airport that is not a commercial service airport that has 10,000 or more enplanements per year;

\(b\) The boarding or deplaning process occurs at a foreign airport;

\(c\) You are using an aircraft subject to an exception from the lift boarding and deplaning assistance requirements under [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.97   To which aircraft does the requirement to provide boarding and deplaning assistance through the use of lifts apply?|§382.97]] (a)-(c) of this subpart;

\(d\) The deadlines established in [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.99   What agreements must carriers have with the airports they serve?|§382.99]](c) have not yet passed; and

\(e\) Circumstances beyond your control (*e.g.,* unusually severe weather; unexpected mechanical problems) prevent the use of a lift.

### §382.103   May a carrier leave a passenger unattended in a wheelchair or other device?

As a carrier, you must not leave a passenger who has requested assistance required by this subpart unattended by the personnel responsible for enplaning, deplaning, or connecting assistance in a ground wheelchair, boarding wheelchair, or other device, in which the passenger is not independently mobile, for more than 30 minutes. This requirement applies even if another person (*e.g.,* family member, personal care attendant) is accompanying the passenger, unless the passenger explicitly waives the obligation.

### §382.105   What is the responsibility of carriers at foreign airports at which airport operators have responsibility for enplaning, deplaning, and connecting assistance?

At a foreign airport at which enplaning, deplaning, or connecting assistance is provided by the airport operator, rather than by carriers, as a carrier you may rely on the services provided by the airport operator to meet the requirements of this subpart. If the services provided by the airport operator are not sufficient to meet the requirements of this subpart, you must supplement the airport operator's services to ensure that these requirements are met. If you believe you are precluded by law from supplementing the airport operator's services, you may apply for a conflict of laws waiver under [[Volume 4/D Special regulations/0382 Nondiscrimination on the basis of disability in air travel.md#§382.9   What may foreign carriers do if they believe a provision of a foreign nation's law conflicts with compliance with a provision of this part?|§382.9]] of this part.

## Subpart H—Services on Aircraft

### §382.111   What services must carriers provide to passengers with a disability on board the aircraft?

As a carrier, you must provide services within the aircraft cabin as requested by or on behalf of passengers with a disability, or when offered by carrier personnel and accepted by passengers with a disability, as follows:

\(c\) You must not require any passenger with a disability to demonstrate that he or she has listened to, read, or understood the information presented, except to the extent that carrier personnel impose such a requirement on all passengers with respect to the general safety briefing. You must not take any action adverse to a qualified individual with a disability on the basis that the person has not “accepted” the briefing.

\(d\) When you conduct an individual safety briefing for a passenger with a disability, you must do so as inconspicuously and discreetly as possible.

\(e\) The accessibility requirements for onboard video safety presentations that carriers must meet are outlined in section 382.69.

### §382.119   What information must carriers give individuals with vision or hearing impairment on aircraft?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must ensure that passengers with a disability who identify themselves as needing visual or hearing assistance have prompt access to the same information provided to other passengers on the aircraft as described in paragraph (b) of this section, to the extent that it does not interfere with crewmembers' safety duties as set forth in FAA and applicable foreign regulations.

\(a\) As a carrier, you must stow wheelchairs, other mobility aids, or other assistive devices in the baggage compartment if an approved stowage area is not available in the cabin or the items cannot be transported in the cabin consistent with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or applicable foreign government requirements concerning security, safety, and hazardous materials with respect to the stowage of carry-on items.

\(b\) You must give wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices priority for stowage in the baggage compartment over other cargo and baggage. Only items that fit into the baggage compartment and can be transported consistent with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or applicable foreign government requirements concerning security, safety, and hazardous materials with respect to the stowage of items in the baggage compartment need be transported. Where this priority results in other passengers' baggage being unable to be carried on the flight, you must make your best efforts to ensure that the other baggage reaches the passengers' destination on the carrier's next flight to the destination.

\(c\) You must provide for the checking and timely return of passengers' wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices as close as possible to the door of the aircraft, so that passengers may use their own equipment to the extent possible, except

\(1\) Where this practice would be inconsistent with Federal regulations governing transportation security or the transportation of hazardous materials; or

\(2\) When the passenger requests the return of the items at the baggage claim area instead of at the door of the aircraft.

\(d\) In order to achieve the timely return of wheelchairs, you must ensure that passengers' wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices are among the first items retrieved from the baggage compartment.

### §382.127   What procedures apply to stowage of battery-powered mobility aids?

\(a\) Whenever baggage compartment size and aircraft airworthiness considerations do not prohibit doing so, you must, as a carrier, accept a passenger's battery-powered wheelchair or other similar mobility device, including the battery, as checked baggage, consistent with the requirements of 49 CFR 175.10(a)(15) and (16) and the provisions of paragraphs (b) through (f) of this section.

\(b\) You may require that passengers with a disability wishing to have battery-powered wheelchairs or other similar mobility devices transported on a flight check in one hour before the check-in time for the general public. If the passenger checks in after this time, you must nonetheless carry the wheelchair or other similar mobility device if you can do so by making a reasonable effort, without delaying the flight.

\(c\) If the battery on the passenger's wheelchair or other similar mobility device has been labeled by the manufacturer as non-spillable as provided in 49 CFR 173.159(d)(2), or if a battery-powered wheelchair with a spillable battery can be loaded, stored, secured and unloaded in an upright position, you must not require the battery to be removed and separately packaged. Notwithstanding this requirement, you must remove and package separately any battery that is inadequately secured to a wheelchair or, for a spillable battery, is contained in a wheelchair that cannot be loaded, stowed, secured and unloaded in an upright position, in accordance with 49 CFR 175.10(a)(15) and (16). A damaged or leaking battery should not be transported.

\(d\) When it is necessary to detach the battery from the wheelchair, you must, upon request, provide packaging for the battery meeting the requirements of 49 CFR 175.10(a)(15) and (16) and package the battery. You may refuse to use packaging materials or devices other than those you normally use for this purpose.

\(e\) You must not disconnect the battery on wheelchairs or other mobility devices equipped with a non-spillable battery completely enclosed within a case or compartment integral to the design of the device unless an FAA or PHMSA safety regulation, or an applicable foreign safety regulation having mandatory legal effect, requires you to do so.

\(f\) You must not drain batteries.

### §382.129   What other requirements apply when passengers' wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices must be disassembled for stowage?

\(a\) As a carrier, you must permit passengers with a disability to provide written directions concerning the disassembly and reassembly of their wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices. You must carry out these instructions to the greatest extent feasible, consistent with FAA, PHMSA, TSA, or applicable foreign government requirements concerning security, safety, and hazardous materials with respect to the stowage of carry-on items.

\(b\) When wheelchairs, other mobility aids, or other assistive devices are disassembled by the carrier for stowage, you must reassemble them and ensure their prompt return to the passenger. You must return wheelchairs, other mobility aids, and other assistive devices to the passenger in the condition in which you received them.

### §382.131   Do baggage liability limits apply to mobility aids and other assistive devices?

With respect to transportation to which [[Volume 4/A Economic regulations/0254 Domestic baggage liability.md|14 CFR part 254]] applies, the limits to liability for loss, damage, or delay concerning wheelchairs or other assistive devices provided in part 254 do not apply.
