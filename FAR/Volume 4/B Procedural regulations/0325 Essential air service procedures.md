### §325.1   Purpose.

The purpose of this part is to establish procedures to be followed in designating eligible places and in determining essential air transportation levels for eligible places, and in the appeals and periodic reviews of these determinations, under 49 U.S.C. 41732.

\[Docket No. 82, 50 FR 2434, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended by Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15938, Apr. 16, 2019\]

### §325.2   Applicability.

This part applies to essential air service determinations for communities designated as eligible under 49 U.S.C. 41731 and to eligible place designations and essential air service determinations for communities that qualify under 49 U.S.C. 41732 and 41733. It applies to the gathering of data by the Department, and to the participation of State, local, and other officials and other interested persons in the designation and determination processes.

Note to §325.2: Criteria for designating eligible points under section 419(b) are contained in part 270 of this chapter. Guidelines for deciding essential air service levels are contained in part 398 of this chapter.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15938, Apr. 16, 2019\]

### §325.3   Definitions.

As used in this part, *eligible place* means a place in the United States that meets the specified criteria outlined in 49 U.S.C. Chapter 417.

\[Doc. No. DOT-OST-2014-0140, 84 FR 15938, Apr. 16, 2019\]

### §325.4   State and local participation.

\(a\) DOT, on a periodic basis, will send a questionnaire to each eligible place that is served by not more than one certificated air carrier, or is designated as an eligible place under 49 U.S.C. 41731, or for which DOT is reviewing its essential air service needs. The questionnaire will be addressed to:

\(1\) The chief executive of the principal city, or other unit of local government at the affected place, that is named or has been previously named in a qualifying section 41102 certificate. For places in Alaska or Hawaii that are named DOT as eligible place without having been listed on a section 41102 certificate, the principal city is the most populous municipality at the place;

\(2\) The individual or entity with direct supervision over and responsibility for the airport at the eligible place; and

\(3\) The State agency with jurisdiction over air transportation in the State containing the eligible place. If there is no such State agency, the questionnaire will be sent to the governor of that State.

\(b\) Within 60 days after receipt of the questionnaire, five copies of the response shall be filed in the Docket Operations Office, unless the Department specifies another date. If no response is received within the period, essential air service for that eligible place may temporarily be set at the minimum level prescribed in 49 U.S.C. 41737.

\(c\) Any other interested person may, during the 60-day response period, submit information relevant to the essential air service level of that eligible place by filing in the Docket Operations Office, five copies of a document titled with the name of the place involved.

\(d\) As necessary, the DOT may request additional information to supplement the questionnaire.

It should contain any facts and arguments that support its requests, and describe the level of essential air service that should be substituted.
