### §323.3   Who shall file notices.

\(a\) *Terminations, suspensions, or reductions by certificated carriers.* The notice described in §323.4(a) shall be filed by any certificated carrier that intends to:

\(1\) Terminate or suspend all passenger air transportation that it is providing to any eligible place in the United States when that termination or suspension will leave no certificated carriers serving that place. Service shall be considered to be terminated or suspended whenever it is operated less than 5 days per week, with three or more intermediate stops, or in one direction only between the two places;

\(2\) Reduce passenger air transportation so that any eligible place receives less than the level of essential air service determined by DOT;

\(3\) Terminate or suspend all passenger air transportation that it is providing to any eligible place in the United States for which DOT has not issued an essential air service determination under either §325.5 or §325.7 of this chapter, when that termination or suspension will leave only one certificated carrier serving that place. Service shall be considered to be terminated or suspended whenever it is operated less than 5 days per week, with three or more intermediate stops, or in one direction only between the two places;

\(4\) Reduce passenger air transportation to any eligible place in Alaska for which DOT has not determined the level of essential air service so that the service between that place and every other place served by a certificated carrier is either:

\(i\) Less than two round trip flights per week, or

\(ii\) Less than the average weekly number of round trip flights actually provided during calendar year 1976, or

\(iii\) Less than the number of flights specified under an agreement between DOT and the State of Alaska; or

\(5\) Terminate, suspend, or reduce passenger air transportation at an eligible place for which DOT has issued, or is required to issue, an essential air service determination under section 41731 or section 41733 of 49 U.S.C. Subtitle VII so that the total available seats of all the carriers linking that place to FAA-designated hubs will be reduced by 33 percent or more during a 90-day period. Service to a hub shall be considered to be terminated or suspended whenever it is operated less than 5 days per week, with three or more intermediate stops, or in one direction only between two places.

\(b\) \[Reserved\]

\(c\) *Uncertificated carriers.* The notice described in §323.4(a) shall be filed by any uncertificated carrier that intends to terminate, suspend, or reduce:

\(1\) Air transportation so that any eligible place receives less than the level of essential air service determined by the DOT;

\(2\) Passenger air transportation to any eligible place for which DOT has not determined the level of essential air service, other than a place in Alaska, so that there is no FAA-designated hub from which the place receives at least two round trip flights per day, 5 days per week; or

\(3\) Passenger air transportation to any eligible place in Alaska, for which DOT has not determined the level of essential air service, so that the service between that place and every other place served by a certificated carrier is either:

\(i\) Less than two round trip flights per week, or

\(ii\) Less than the average number of weekly round trip flights actually provided during calendar year 1976, or

\(iii\) Less than the number of flights specified under an agreement between DOT and the State of Alaska.

\(d\) For the purpose of this section, in ascertaining the level of air transportation being provided to a place or between two places, air transportation that has been the subject of a notice filed under this section shall be considered not in operation for the duration of the notice period.

\(e\) If a certificated carrier was, before October 24, 1978, granted authority to suspend air transportation, and that authority ends on a stated date, the carrier shall comply with the requirements of this part before continuing the suspension beyond that date.

\(f\) If a certificated carrier was, before October 24, 1978, granted authority to terminate or suspend air transportation, but has not suspended service, the carrier shall comply with the requirements of this part before terminating or suspending service.

\[Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2430, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended by Doc. No. OST-96-1269, 61 FR 19166, May 1, 1996\]

### §323.14   Temporary suspension authority for involuntary interruption of service.

\(a\) Any air carrier may temporarily suspend service without filing a notice under §323.3 for any interruption of service that the carrier cannot reasonably be expected to foresee or control, such as rules, standards, or other action, or inaction, of the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration or of a foreign government, emergency measures, strikes, weather conditions, construction work on airports, or disasters. However, the provisions of this paragraph shall apply to interruptions due to airport inadequacies only if the carrier is unable to serve the place through any airport convenient to the place with the type of equipment last regularly used to serve the place.

\(b\) In the case of an interruption of service caused by a strike, the carrier shall give immediate notice of the interruption to DOT. Suspension authority under this section due to a strike shall expire 90 days after employees return to work.

\(c\) If service to a place is interrupted for more than 3 consecutive days for reasons beyond the carrier's control other than a strike, the holder shall give notice to DOT within 3 days following the date of first interruption, setting forth the date of first interruption and a full statement of the reasons for the interruption.

### §323.15   Report to be filed after strikes.

\(a\) Within 15 days following resumption of service after a strike, an air carrier shall file a report with DOT containing a list of all flights that were canceled, the date they were canceled, and the date service was resumed.

\(b\) The report shall be marked for the attention of the Director, Office of Aviation Analysis.

(Approved by the Office of Management and Budget under control number 3024-0030)

\[Doc. No. 82, 50 FR 2430, Jan. 16, 1985, as amended by Doc. No. OST-96-1269, 61 FR 19166, May 1, 1996\]

### §323.16   Listings in schedule publications.

Each air carrier filing a notice under §323.3 (a)(2), (a)(4), (a)(5), or (c) shall continue to list the affected flights in all generally-distributed schedule publications in which the flight was listed before the notice. The listings shall continue until DOT permits the flights to be discontinued. The listings may include a notice stating that the flights are “to be discontinued as of (date) subject to government approval.”

### §323.17   Delays in discontinuing service.

If transportation that is the subject of a notice under this part is not discontinued within 90 days of the intended date stated in the notice, a new notice must be filed before the service may be discontinued. However, if DOT requires the carrier to provide service beyond the stated date, the carrier need not file a new notice if it discontinues the service within 90 days after DOT permits it to do so.

### §323.18   Carriers' obligations when terminating, suspending, or reducing air service.

Any air carrier that terminates, suspends, or reduces air service, whether or not subject to the notice requirements of this part, shall make reasonable efforts to contact all passengers holding reservations on the affected flights to inform them of the flights' cancellation.

### §323.19   Withdrawal notice by exemption carriers in certain limited-entry markets.

As a condition on the exemption, an air carrier operating under exemption authority in an international market which is the subject of a carrier selection proceeding shall file a notice with the Department at least ninety days before it terminates service in that market. Once such a notice has been filed, the carrier may not terminate service in that market during the notice period unless the air carrier chosen in the selection proceeding enters the market and the Department grants the operating carrier permission to do so. The Department may allow earlier termination for good cause when in the public interest.
