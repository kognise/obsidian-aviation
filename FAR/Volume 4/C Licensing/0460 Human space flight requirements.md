\(3\) A crew member participating in an activity authorized under this chapter.

\(b\) Each member of the crew must comply with all requirements of the laws of the United States that apply to crew.

### §460.5   Crew qualifications and training.

\(a\) Each crew member must—

\(1\) Complete training on how to carry out his or her role on board or on the ground so that the vehicle will not harm the public; and

\(2\) Train for his or her role in nominal and non-nominal conditions. The conditions must include—

\(i\) Abort scenarios; and

\(ii\) Emergency operations.

\(b\) Each member of a flight crew must demonstrate an ability to withstand the stresses of space flight, which may include high acceleration or deceleration, microgravity, and vibration, in sufficient condition to safely carry out his or her duties so that the vehicle will not harm the public.

\(c\) A pilot and a remote operator must—

\(1\) Possess and carry an FAA pilot certificate with an instrument rating.

\(2\) Possess aeronautical knowledge, experience, and skills necessary to pilot and control the launch or reentry vehicle that will operate in the National Airspace System (NAS). Aeronautical experience may include hours in flight, ratings, and training.

\(3\) Receive vehicle and mission-specific training for each phase of flight by using one or more of the following—

### §460.17   Verification program.

An operator must successfully verify the integrated performance of a vehicle's hardware and any software in an operational flight environment before allowing any space flight participant on board during a flight. Verification must include flight testing.

### §460.19   Crew waiver of claims against U.S. Government.
