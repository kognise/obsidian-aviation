\(a\) *Scope.* This part sets forth—

\(1\) The responsibilities of a launch operator conducting a licensed launch of an expendable launch vehicle; and

\(2\) The requirements for maintaining a launch license obtained under [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0415 Launch license.md|part 415 of this chapter]]. Parts 413 and 415 of this chapter contain requirements for preparing a license application to conduct a launch, including information reviewed by the FAA to conduct a policy, safety, payload, and environmental review., and a payload determination.

\(b\) *Applicability.* (1) The administrative requirements for filing material with the FAA in subpart A of this part apply to all licensed launches from a Federal launch range or a non-Federal launch site, except where noted.

\(2\) The safety requirements of subparts B through E of this part apply to all licensed launches of expendable launch vehicles. See paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section for exceptions to this provision.

\(c\) *“Meets intent”* certification. For a licensed launch from a Federal launch range, a launch operator need not demonstrate to the FAA that an alternative means of satisfying a requirement of this part provides an equivalent level of safety for a launch if written evidence demonstrates that a Federal launch range has, by the effective date of this part, granted a “meets intent certification,” including through “tailoring,” that applies to the requirement and that launch. See paragraph (f) of this section for exceptions to this provision. Written evidence includes:

\(1\) Range flight plan approval,

\(2\) Missile system pre-launch safety package,

\(3\) Preliminary and final flight data packages,

\(4\) A tailored version of EWR 127-1,

\(5\) Range email to the FAA stating that the MIC was approved, or

\(6\) Operation approval.

\(d\) *Waiver.* For a licensed launch from a Federal launch range, a requirement of this part does not apply to a launch if written evidence demonstrates that a Federal launch range has, by the effective date of this part, granted a waiver that allows noncompliance with the requirement for that launch. See paragraph (f) of this section for exceptions to this provision. Written evidence includes:

\(1\) Range flight plan approval,

\(2\) Missile system pre-launch safety package,

\(3\) Preliminary and final flight data packages,

\(4\) A tailored version of EWR 127-1,

\(5\) Range email to the FAA stating that the waiver was approved, or

\(6\) Operation approval.

\(e\) *Grandfathering.* For a licensed launch from a Federal launch range, a requirement of this part does not apply to the launch if the Federal launch range's grandfathering criteria allow noncompliance with the requirement for that launch. See paragraph (f) of this section for exceptions to this provision.

\(f\) *Exceptions to Federal launch range meets intent certifications, waivers, and grandfathering.* Even if a licensed launch from a Federal launch range satisfies paragraph (c), (d), or (e) of this section for a requirement of this part, the requirement applies and a launch operator must satisfy the requirement, obtain FAA approval of any alternative, or obtain FAA approval for any further noncompliance if—

\(1\) The launch operator modifies the launch vehicle's operation or safety characteristics;

\(2\) The launch operator uses the launch vehicle, component, system, or subsystem in a new application;

\(3\) The FAA or the launch operator determines that a previously unforeseen or newly discovered safety hazard exists that is a source of significant risk to public safety; or

\(4\) The Federal launch range previously accepted a component, system, or subsystem, but did not then identify a noncompliance to a Federal launch range requirement.

\(g\) *Equivalent level of safety.* The requirements of this part apply to a launch operator and the launch operator's launch unless the launch operator clearly and convincingly demonstrates that an alternative approach provides an equivalent level of safety.

## Subpart B—Launch Safety Responsibilities

### §417.101   Scope.

This subpart contains public safety requirements that apply to the launch of an orbital or suborbital expendable launch vehicle from a Federal launch range or other launch site. If the FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that an applicable range safety-related launch service or property satisfies the requirements of this subpart, then the FAA will treat the Federal launch range's launch service or property as that of a launch operator without need for further demonstration of compliance to the FAA if:

\(a\) A launch operator has contracted with a Federal launch range for the provision of the safety-related launch service or property; and

\(b\) The FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that the Federal launch range's safety-related launch service or property satisfy the requirements of this subpart. In this case, the FAA will treat the Federal launch range's process as that of a launch operator.

### §417.103   Safety organization.

\(a\) A launch operator must maintain and document a safety organization. A launch operator must identify lines of communication and approval authority for all public safety decisions, including those regarding design, operations, and analysis. A launch operator must describe its lines of communication, both within the launch operator's organization and between the launch operator and any federal launch range or other launch site operator providing launch services, in writing. Documented approval authority shall also be employed by the launch operator throughout the life of the launch system to ensure public safety and compliance with this part.

\(b\) A launch operator's safety organization must include, but need not be limited to, the following launch management positions:

[Link to an extension of the above amendment published at 86 FR 13448, Mar. 9, 2021.](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=4a24d322e7e2ad451d1f786b051cf52a&mc=true&node=20210309y1.1)

\(a\) *Flight safety system.* For each launch vehicle, vehicle component, and payload, a launch operator must use a flight safety system that satisfies subpart D of this part as follows, unless [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.125   Launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle.|§417.125]] applies.

\(1\) *In the vicinity of the launch site.* For each launch vehicle, vehicle component, and payload, a launch operator must use a flight safety system in the vicinity of the launch site if the following exist:

\(i\) Any hazard from a launch vehicle, vehicle component, or payload can reach any protected area at any time during flight; or

\(ii\) A failure of the launch vehicle would have a high consequence to the public.

\(2\) *In the downrange area.* For each launch vehicle, vehicle component, and payload, a launch operator must provide a flight safety system downrange if the absence of a flight safety system would significantly increase the accumulated risk from debris impacts.

\(b\) *Public risk criteria.* A launch operator may initiate the flight of a launch vehicle only if flight safety analysis performed under paragraph (f) of this section demonstrates that any risk to the public satisfies the following public risk criteria:

\(1\) A launch operator may initiate the flight of a launch vehicle only if the total risk associated with the launch to all members of the public, excluding persons in water-borne vessels and aircraft, does not exceed an expected number of 1 × 10−4 casualties. The total risk consists of risk posed by impacting inert and explosive debris, toxic release, and far field blast overpressure. The FAA will determine whether to approve public risk due to any other hazard associated with the proposed flight of a launch vehicle on a case-by-case basis. The Ec criterion applies to each launch from lift-off through orbital insertion for an orbital launch, and through final impact for a suborbital launch.

\(2\) A launch operator may initiate flight only if the risk to any individual member of the public does not exceed a casualty expectation of 1 × 10−6 per launch for each hazard.

\(3\) A launch operator must establish any water borne vessel hazard areas necessary to ensure the probability of impact (Pi) with debris capable of causing a casualty for water borne vessels does not exceed 1 × 10−5.

\(4\) A launch operator must establish any aircraft hazard areas necessary to ensure the probability of impact (Pi) with debris capable of causing a casualty for aircraft does not exceed 1 × 10−6.

\(c\) *Debris thresholds.* A launch operator's flight safety analysis, performed as required by paragraph (f) of this section, must account for any inert debris impact with a mean expected kinetic energy at impact greater than or equal to 11 ft-lbs and, except for the far field blast overpressure effects analysis of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.229   Far-field overpressure blast effects analysis.|§417.229]], a peak incident overpressure greater than or equal to 1.0 psi due to any explosive debris impact.

\(1\) When using the 11 ft-lbs threshold to determine potential casualties due to blunt trauma from inert debris impacts, the analysis must:

\(i\) Incorporate a probabilistic model that accounts for the probability of casualty due to any debris expected to impact with kinetic energy of 11 ft-lbs or greater and satisfy paragraph (d) of this section; or

\(ii\) Count each expected impact with kinetic energy of 11 ft-lbs or greater to a person as a casualty.

\(2\) When applying the 1.0 psi threshold to determine potential casualties due to blast overpressure effects, the analysis must:

\(i\) Incorporate a probabilistic model that accounts for the probability of casualty due to any blast overpressures of 1.0 psi or greater and satisfy paragraph (d) of this section; or

\(ii\) Count each person within the 1.0 psi overpressure radius of the source explosion as a casualty. When using this approach, the analysis must compute the peak incident overpressure using the Kingery-Bulmash relationship and may not take into account sheltering, reflections, or atmospheric effects. For persons located in buildings, the analysis must compute the peak incident overpressure for the shortest distance between the building and the blast source. The analysis must count each person located anywhere in a building subjected to peak incident overpressure equal to or greater than 1.0 psi as a casualty.

\(d\) *Casualty modeling.* A probabilistic casualty model must be based on accurate data and scientific principles and must be statistically valid. A launch operator must obtain FAA approval of any probabilistic casualty model that is used in the flight safety analysis. If the launch takes place from a Federal launch range, the analysis may employ any probabilistic casualty model that the FAA accepts as part of the FAA's launch site safety assessment of the Federal launch range's safety process.

\(e\) *Collision avoidance.* (1) A launch operator must ensure that a launch vehicle, any jettisoned components, and its payload do not pass closer than 200 kilometers to a manned or mannable orbital object—

\(i\) Throughout a sub-orbital launch; or

\(ii\) For an orbital launch:

\(A\) During ascent to initial orbital insertion and through at least one complete orbit; and

\(B\) During each subsequent orbital maneuver or burn from initial park orbit, or direct ascent to a higher or interplanetary orbit or until clear of all manned or mannable objects, whichever occurs first.

\(2\) A launch operator must obtain a collision avoidance analysis for each launch from United States Strategic Command or from a Federal range having an approved launch site safety assessment. United States Strategic Command calls this analysis a conjunction on launch assessment. Sections 417.231 and A417.31 of appendix A of this part contain the requirements for obtaining a collision avoidance analysis. A launch operator must use the results of the collision avoidance analysis to develop flight commit criteria for collision avoidance as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.113   Launch safety rules.|§417.113]](c).

\(f\) *Flight safety analysis.* A launch operator must perform and document a flight safety analysis as required by subpart C of this part. A launch operator must not initiate flight unless the flight safety analysis demonstrates that any risk to the public satisfies the public risk criteria of paragraph (b) of this section. For a licensed launch that involves a Federal launch range, the FAA will treat an analysis performed and documented by the Federal range, and which has an FAA approved launch site safety assessment, as that of the launch operator as provided in [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§417.203]](d) of subpart C of this part. A launch operator must use the flight safety analysis products to develop flight safety rules that govern a launch. Section 417.113 contains the requirements for flight safety rules.

\(1\) The flight-commit criteria must implement the flight safety analysis of subpart C of this part. These must include criteria for:

\(i\) Surveillance of any region of land, sea, or air necessary to ensure the number and location of members of the public are consistent with the inputs used for the flight safety analysis of subpart C of this part;

\(ii\) Monitoring of any meteorological condition and implementing any flight constraint developed using appendix G of this part. The launch operator must have clear and convincing evidence that the lightning flight commit criteria of appendix G, which apply to the conditions present at the time of lift-off, are not violated. If any other hazardous conditions exist, other than those identified by appendix G, the launch weather team will report the hazardous condition to the official designated under [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.103   Safety organization.|§417.103]](b)(1), who will determine whether initiating flight would expose the launch vehicle to a lightning hazard and not initiate flight in the presence of the hazard; and

\(iii\) Implementation of any launch wait in the launch window for the purpose of collision avoidance.

\(2\) For a launch that uses a flight safety system, the flight-commit criteria must ensure that the flight safety system is ready for flight. This must include criteria for ensuring that:

\(i\) The flight safety system is operating to ensure the launch vehicle will launch within all flight safety limits;

\(ii\) Any command transmitter system required by section D417.9 has sufficient coverage from lift-off to the point in flight where the flight safety system is no longer required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](a);

\(iii\) The launch vehicle tracking system has no less than two tracking sources prior to lift-off. The launch vehicle tracking system has no less than one verified tracking source at all times from lift-off to orbit insertion for an orbital launch, to the end of powered flight for a suborbital launch; and

\(iv\) The launch operator will employ its flight safety system as designed in accordance with this part.

\(3\) For each launch, a launch operator must document the actual conditions used for the flight-commit criteria at the time of lift-off and verify whether the flight-commit criteria are satisfied.

\(d\) *Flight termination rules.* For a launch that uses a flight safety system, the launch safety rules must identify the conditions under which the flight safety system, including the functions of the flight safety system crew, must terminate flight to ensure public safety. These flight termination rules must implement the flight safety analysis of subpart C of this part and include each of the following:

\(1\) The flight safety system must terminate flight when valid, real-time data indicate the launch vehicle has violated any flight safety limit of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.213   Flight safety limits analysis.|§417.213]];

\(2\) The flight safety system must terminate flight at the straight-up-time required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.215   Straight-up time analysis.|§417.215]] if the launch vehicle continues to fly a straight up trajectory and, therefore, does not turn downrange when it should;

\(3\) The flight safety system must terminate flight when all of the following conditions exist:

\(i\) Real-time data indicate that the performance of the launch vehicle is erratic;

\(ii\) The potential exists for the loss of flight safety system control of the launch vehicle and further flight has the potential to endanger the public.

\(4\) The flight termination rules must incorporate the data-loss flight times and planned safe flight state of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.219   Data loss flight time and planned safe flight state analyses.|§417.219]], including each of the following:

\(i\) The flight safety system must terminate flight no later than the first data-loss flight time if, by that time, tracking of the launch vehicle is not established and vehicle position and status is unknown; and

\(ii\) Once launch vehicle tracking is established and there is a subsequent loss of verified tracking data before the planned safe flight state and verified tracking data is not received again, the flight safety system must terminate flight no later than the expiration of the data-loss flight time for the point in flight that the data was lost.

\(5\) For any gate established under [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.217   Overflight gate analysis.|§417.217]], both of the following apply:

\(i\) The flight safety system must terminate flight if the launch vehicle is performing erratically immediately prior to entering the gate.

\(ii\) The flight termination rules may permit the instantaneous impact point or other tracking icon to cross the gate only if there is no indication that the launch vehicle's performance has become erratic and the launch vehicle is either flying parallel to the nominal trajectory or converging to the nominal trajectory.

\(6\) For any hold-and-resume gate established under [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.218   Hold-and-resume gate analysis.|§417.218]];

\(i\) The flight safety system must terminate flight if the launch vehicle is performing erratically immediately prior to entering a hold gate.

\(ii\) The flight termination rules may permit the instantaneous impact point or other tracking icon to cross a hold gate only if there is no indication that the launch vehicle's performance has become erratic and the vehicle is either flying parallel to the nominal trajectory or converging to the nominal trajectory.

\(iii\) The flight termination rules of paragraphs (d)(1), (d)(3), and (d)(4) of this section apply after the instantaneous impact point or other tracking icon exits a resume gate.

\(e\) *Flight safety system safing.* For a launch that uses a flight safety system, the launch safety rules must ensure that any safing of the flight safety system occurs on or after the point in flight where the flight safety system is no longer required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](b).

\(f\) *Launch crew work shift and rest rules.* For any operation with the potential to have an adverse effect on public safety, the launch safety rules must ensure the launch crew is physically and mentally capable of performing all assigned tasks. These rules must govern the length, number, and frequency of work shifts, including the rest afforded the launch crew between shifts.

### §417.115   Tests.

\(a\) *General.* All flight, communication, and ground systems and equipment that a launch operator uses to protect the public from any adverse effects of a launch, must undergo testing as required by this part, and any corrective action and re-testing necessary to ensure reliable operation.

\(a\) *Applicability.* This section applies only to a launch operator conducting a launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle.

\(b\) *Need for flight safety system.* A launch operator must launch an unguided suborbital launch vehicle with a flight safety system in accordance with [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]] (a) and subpart D of this part unless one of the following exceptions applies:

\(1\) The unguided suborbital launch vehicle, including any component or payload, does not have sufficient energy to reach any populated area in any direction from the launch point; or

\(2\) A launch operator demonstrates through the licensing process that the launch will be conducted using a wind weighting safety system that meets the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section.

\(c\) *Wind weighting safety system.* A launch operator's wind weighting safety system must consist of equipment, procedures, analysis and personnel functions used to determine the launcher elevation and azimuth settings that correct for the windcocking and wind drift that an unguided suborbital launch vehicle will experience during flight due to wind effects. The launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle that uses a wind weighting safety system must meet the following requirements:

\(1\) The unguided suborbital launch vehicle must not contain a guidance or directional control system.

\(2\) The launcher azimuth and elevation settings must be wind weighted to correct for the effects of wind conditions at the time of flight to provide a safe impact location. A launch operator must conduct the launch in accordance with the wind weighting analysis requirements and methods of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.233   Analysis for an unguided suborbital launch vehicle flown with a wind weighting safety system.|§417.233]] and appendix C of this part.

\(3\) A launch operator must use a launcher elevation angle setting that ensures the rocket will not fly uprange. A launch operator must set the launcher elevation angle in accordance with the following:

\(i\) The nominal launcher elevation angle must not exceed 85°. The wind corrected launcher elevation setting must not exceed 86°.

\(ii\) For an unproven unguided suborbital launch vehicle, the nominal launcher elevation angle must not exceed 80°. The wind corrected launcher elevation setting must not exceed 84°. A proven unguided suborbital launch vehicle is one that has demonstrated, by two or more launches, that flight performance errors are within all the three-sigma dispersion parameters modeled in the wind weighting safety system.

\(d\) *Public risk criteria.* A launch operator must conduct the launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle in accordance with the public risk criteria of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](b). The risk to the public determined prior to the day of flight must satisfy the public risk criteria for the area defined by the range of nominal launch azimuths. A launch operator must not initiate flight until a launch operator has verified that the wind drifted impacts of all planned impacts and their five-sigma dispersion areas satisfy the public risk criteria after wind weighting on the day of flight.

\(e\) *Stability.* An unguided suborbital launch vehicle, in all configurations, must be stable in flexible body to 1.5 calibers and rigid body to 2.0 calibers throughout each stage of powered flight. A caliber, for a rocket configuration, is defined as the distance between the center of pressure and the center of gravity divided by the largest frontal diameter of the rocket configuration.

\(f\) *Tracking.* A launch operator must track the flight of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle. The tracking system must provide data to determine the actual impact locations of all stages and components, to verify the effectiveness of a launch operator's wind weighting safety system, and to obtain rocket performance data for comparison with the preflight performance predictions.

\(g\) *Post-launch review.* A launch operator must ensure that the post-launch report required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.25   Post launch report.|§417.25]] includes:

\(1\) Actual impact location of all impacting stages and each impacting component.

\(2\) A comparison of actual and predicted nominal performance.

\(3\) Investigation results of any launch anomaly. If flight performance deviates by more than a three-sigma dispersion from the nominal trajectory, a launch operator must conduct an investigation to determine the cause of the rocket's deviation from normal flight and take corrective action before the next launch. A launch operator must file any corrective actions with the FAA as a request for license modification before the next launch in accordance with [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.11   Continuing accuracy of license application; application for modification of license.|§417.11]].

### §417.127   Unique safety policies, requirements and practices.

For each launch, a launch operator must review operations, system designs, analysis, and testing, and identify any unique hazards not otherwise addressed by this part. A launch operator must implement any unique safety policy, requirement, or practice needed to protect the public from the unique hazard. A launch operator must demonstrate through the licensing process that any unique safety policy, requirement, or practice ensures the safety of the public. For any change to a unique safety policy, requirement, or practice, with the exception of a launch specific update, the launch operator must file a request for license modification as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.11   Continuing accuracy of license application; application for modification of license.|§417.11]]. The FAA may identify and impose a unique safety policy, requirement, or practice as needed to protect the public.

### §417.129   Safety at end of launch.

A launch operator must ensure for any proposed launch that for all launch vehicle stages or components that reach Earth orbit—

\(a\) There is no unplanned physical contact between the vehicle or any of its components and the payload after payload separation;

\(b\) Debris generation does not result from the conversion of energy sources into energy that fragments the vehicle or its components. Energy sources include chemical, pressure, and kinetic energy; and

\(c\) Stored energy is removed by depleting residual fuel and leaving all fuel line valves open, venting any pressurized system, leaving all batteries in a permanent discharge state, and removing any remaining source of stored energy.

### §§417.130-417.200   \[Reserved\]

## Subpart C—Flight Safety Analysis

### §417.201   Scope and applicability.

\(a\) This subpart contains requirements for performing the flight safety analysis required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](f).

\(b\) The flight safety analysis requirements of this subpart apply to the flight of any launch vehicle that must use a flight safety system as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](a), except as permitted by paragraph (d) of this section.

\(c\) The flight safety analysis requirements of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§§417.203]], 417.205, 417.207, 417.211, 417.223, 417.224, 417.225, 417.227, 417.229, 417.231, and 417.233 apply to the flight of any unguided suborbital launch vehicle that uses a wind-weighting safety system. Appendices B, C, and I of this part also apply.

\(d\) For any alternative flight safety system approved by the FAA under [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.301   General.|§417.301]](b), the FAA will determine during the licensing process which of the analyses required by this subpart apply.

### §417.203   Compliance.

\(a\) *General.* A launch operator's flight safety analysis must satisfy the performance requirements of this subpart. The flight safety analysis must also meet the requirements for methods of analysis contained in appendices A and B of this part for a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system and appendices B and C of this part for an unguided suborbital launch vehicle that uses a wind-weighting safety system except as otherwise permitted by this section. A flight safety analysis for a launch may rely on an earlier analysis from an identical or similar launch if the analysis still applies to the later launch.

\(b\) *Method of analysis.* (1) For each launch, a launch operator's flight safety analysis must use—

\(i\) A method approved by the FAA during the licensing process;

\(ii\) A method approved as a license modification by the FAA; or,

\(iii\) If the launch takes place from a Federal launch range, a method approved as part of the FAA's launch site safety assessment of the Federal range's processes.

\(2\) Appendix A of this part contains requirements that apply to all methods of flight safety analysis. A licensee must notify the FAA for any change to the flight safety analysis method. A licensee must file any material change with the FAA as a request for license modification before the launch to which the proposed change would apply. Section 417.11 contains requirements governing a license modification.

\(c\) *Alternate analysis method.* The FAA will approve an alternate flight safety analysis method if a launch operator demonstrates, in accordance with [[Volume 4/B Procedure/0406 Investigations, enforcement, and administrative review.md#§406.3   Submissions; oral presentation in license, permit, and payload actions.|§406.3]](b), that its proposed analysis method provides an equivalent level of fidelity to that required by this subpart. A launch operator must demonstrate that an alternate flight safety analysis method is based on accurate data and scientific principles and is statistically valid. The FAA will not find a launch operator's application for a license or license modification sufficiently complete to begin review under [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0413 License application procedures.md#§413.11   Acceptance of an application.|§413.11]] of this chapter until the FAA approves the alternate flight safety analysis method.

\(d\) *Analyses performed by a Federal launch range.* This provision applies to all sections of this subpart. The FAA will accept a flight safety analysis used by a Federal launch range without need for further demonstration of compliance to the FAA, if:

\(1\) A launch operator has contracted with a Federal launch range for the provision of flight safety analysis; and

\(2\) The FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that the range's analysis methods satisfy the requirements of this subpart. In this case, the FAA will treat the Federal launch range's analysis as that of a launch operator.

\(e\) *Analysis products.* For a licensed launch that does not satisfy paragraph (d) of this section, a launch operator must demonstrate to the FAA compliance with the requirements of this subpart, and must include in its demonstration the analysis products required by part 415 subpart F of this chapter, part 417 subpart A, and appendices A, B, C, and I of this part, depending on whether the launch vehicle uses a flight safety system or a wind-weighting safety system.

### §417.205   General.

\(a\) *Public risk management.* A flight safety analysis must demonstrate that a launch operator will, for each launch, control the risk to the public from hazards associated with normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight. The analysis must employ risk assessment, hazard isolation, or a combination of risk assessment and partial isolation of the hazards, to demonstrate control of the risk to the public.

\(1\) *Risk assessment.* When demonstrating control of risk through risk assessment, the analysis must demonstrate that any risk to the public satisfies the public risk criteria of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](b). The analysis must account for the variability associated with:

\(i\) Each source of a hazard during flight;

\(ii\) Normal flight and each failure response mode of the launch vehicle;

\(iii\) Each external and launch vehicle flight environment;

\(iv\) Populations potentially exposed to the flight; and

\(v\) The performance of any flight safety system, including time delays associated with the system.

\(2\) *Hazard isolation.* When demonstrating control of risk through hazard isolation, the analysis must establish the geographical areas from which the public must be excluded during flight and any operational controls needed to isolate all hazards from the public.

\(3\) *Combination of risk assessment and partial isolation of hazards.* When demonstrating control of risk through a combination of risk assessment and partial isolation of the hazards from the public, the analysis must demonstrate that the residual public risk due to any hazard not isolated from the public under paragraph (a)(2) of this section satisfies the public risk criteria of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](b).

\(b\) *Dependent analyses.* Because some analyses required by this subpart are inherently dependent on one another, the data output of any one analysis must be compatible in form and content with the data input requirements of any other analysis that depends on that output. Figure 417.205-1 illustrates the flight safety analyses that might be performed for a launch flown with a flight safety system and the typical dependencies that might exist among the analyses.

### §417.207   Trajectory analysis.

\(a\) *General.* A flight safety analysis must include a trajectory analysis that establishes:

\(1\) For any time after lift-off, the limits of a launch vehicle's normal flight, as defined by the nominal trajectory and potential three-sigma trajectory dispersions about the nominal trajectory.

\(2\) A fuel exhaustion trajectory that produces instantaneous impact points with the greatest range for any given time after liftoff for any stage that has the potential to impact the Earth and does not burn to propellant depletion before a programmed thrust termination.

\(3\) For launch vehicles flown with a flight safety system, a straight-up trajectory for any time after lift-off until the straight-up time that would result if the launch vehicle malfunctioned and flew in a vertical or near vertical direction above the launch point.

\(b\) *Trajectory model.* A final trajectory analysis must use a six-degree of freedom trajectory model to satisfy the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section.

\(c\) *Wind effects.* A trajectory analysis must account for all wind effects, including profiles of winds that are no less severe than the worst wind conditions under which flight might be attempted, and must account for uncertainty in the wind conditions.

### §417.209   Malfunction turn analysis.

\(a\) *General.* A flight safety analysis must include a malfunction turn analysis that establishes the launch vehicle's turning capability in the event of a malfunction during flight. A malfunction turn analysis must account for each cause of a malfunction turn, such as thrust vector offsets or nozzle burn-through. For each cause of a malfunction turn, the analysis must establish the launch vehicle's turning capability using a set of turn curves. The analysis must account for:

\(1\) All trajectory times during the thrusting phases of flight.

\(2\) When a malfunction begins to cause each turn throughout the thrusting phases of flight. The analysis must account for trajectory time intervals between malfunction turn start times that are sufficient to establish flight safety limits and hazard areas that are smooth and continuous.

\(3\) The relative probability of occurrence of each malfunction turn of which the launch vehicle is capable.

\(4\) The time, as a single value or a probability time distribution, when each malfunction turn will terminate due to vehicle breakup.

\(5\) What terminates each malfunction turn, such as, aerodynamic breakup or inertial breakup.

\(6\) The launch vehicle's turning behavior from the time when a malfunction begins to cause a turn until aerodynamic breakup, inertial breakup, or ground impact. The analysis must account for trajectory time intervals during the malfunction turn that are sufficient to establish turn curves that are smooth and continuous.

\(7\) For each malfunction turn, the launch vehicle velocity vector turn angle from the nominal launch vehicle velocity vector.

\(8\) For each malfunction turn, the launch vehicle velocity turn magnitude from the nominal velocity magnitude that corresponds to the velocity vector turn angle.

\(9\) For each malfunction turn, the orientation of the launch vehicle longitudinal axis measured relative to the nominal launch vehicle longitudinal axis or Earth relative velocity vector at the start of the turn.

\(b\) *Set of turn curves for each malfunction turn cause.* For each cause of a malfunction turn, the analysis must establish a set of turn curves that satisfies paragraph (a) of this section and must establish the associated envelope of the set of turn curves. Each set of turn curves must describe the variation in the malfunction turn characteristics for each cause of a turn. The envelope of each set of curves must define the limits of the launch vehicle's malfunction turn behavior for each cause of a malfunction turn. For each malfunction turn envelope, the analysis must establish the launch vehicle velocity vector turn angle from the nominal launch vehicle velocity vector. For each malfunction turn envelope, the analysis must establish the vehicle velocity turn magnitude from the nominal velocity magnitude that corresponds to the velocity vector turn angle envelope.

### §417.211   Debris analysis.

\(a\) *General.* A flight safety analysis must include a debris analysis. For an orbital or suborbital launch, a debris analysis must identify the inert, explosive, and other hazardous launch vehicle debris that results from normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight.

\(b\) *Launch vehicle breakup.* A debris analysis must account for each cause of launch vehicle breakup, including at a minimum:

\(1\) Any flight termination system activation;

\(2\) Launch vehicle explosion;

\(3\) Aerodynamic loads;

\(4\) Inertial loads;

\(5\) Atmospheric reentry heating; and

\(6\) Impact of intact vehicle.

\(c\) *Debris fragment lists.* A debris analysis must produce lists of debris fragments for each cause of breakup and any planned jettison of debris, launch vehicle components, or payload. The lists must account for all launch vehicle debris fragments, individually or in groupings of fragments whose characteristics are similar enough to be described by a single set of characteristics. The debris lists must describe the physical, aerodynamic, and harmful characteristics of each debris fragment, including at a minimum:

\(1\) Origin on the vehicle, by vehicle stage or component, from which each fragment originated;

\(2\) Whether it is inert or explosive;

\(3\) Weight, dimensions, and shape;

\(4\) Lift and drag characteristics;

\(5\) Properties of the incremental velocity distribution imparted by breakup; and

\(6\) Axial, transverse, and tumbling area.

### §417.213   Flight safety limits analysis.

\(a\) *General.* A flight safety analysis must identify the location of populated or other protected areas, and establish flight safety limits that define when a flight safety system must terminate a launch vehicle's flight to prevent the hazardous effects of the resulting debris impacts from reaching any populated or other protected area and ensure that the launch satisfies the public risk criteria of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](b).

\(b\) *Flight safety limits.* The analysis must establish flight safety limits for use in establishing flight termination rules. Section 417.113(c) contains requirements for flight termination rules. The flight safety limits must account for all temporal and geometric extents on the Earth's surface of a launch vehicle's hazardous debris impact dispersion resulting from any planned or unplanned event for all times during flight. Flight safety limits must account for all potential contributions to the debris impact dispersions, including at a minimum:

\(1\) All time delays, as established by the time delay analysis of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.221   Time delay analysis.|§417.221]];

\(2\) Residual thrust remaining after flight termination implementation or vehicle breakup due to aerodynamic and inertial loads;

\(3\) All wind effects;

\(4\) Velocity imparted to vehicle fragments by breakup;

\(5\) All lift and drag forces on the malfunctioning vehicle and falling debris;

\(6\) All launch vehicle guidance and performance errors;

\(7\) All launch vehicle malfunction turn capabilities; and

\(8\) Any uncertainty due to map errors and launch vehicle tracking errors.

\(c\) *Gates.* If a launch involves flight over any populated or other protected area, the flight safety analysis must establish a gate as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.217   Overflight gate analysis.|§§417.217]] and 417.218.

\(d\) *Designated debris impact limits.* The analysis must establish designated impact limit lines to bound the area where debris with a ballistic coefficient of three or more is allowed to impact if the flight safety system functions properly.

### §417.215   Straight-up time analysis.

A flight safety analysis must establish the straight-up time for a launch for use as a flight termination rule. Section 417.113(c) contains requirements for flight termination rules. The analysis must establish the straight-up time as the latest time after liftoff, assuming a launch vehicle malfunctioned and flew in a vertical or near vertical direction above the launch point, at which activation of the launch vehicle's flight termination system or breakup of the launch vehicle would not cause hazardous debris or critical overpressure to affect any populated or other protected area.

### §417.217   Overflight gate analysis.

For a launch that involves flight over a populated or other protected area, the flight safety analysis must include an overflight gate analysis. The analysis must establish the portion of a flight safety limit, a gate, through which a normally performing launch vehicle's tracking icon will be allowed to proceed. A tracking icon must enable the flight safety crew to determine whether the launch vehicle's flight is in compliance with the flight safety rules established under [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.113   Launch safety rules.|§417.113]]. When establishing that portion of a flight safety limit, the analysis must demonstrate that the launch vehicle flight satisfies the flight safety requirements of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]].

### §417.218   Hold-and-resume gate analysis.

\(a\) For a launch that involves overflight or near overflight of a populated or otherwise protected area prior to the planned safe flight state calculated as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.219   Data loss flight time and planned safe flight state analyses.|§417.219]], the flight safety analysis must construct a hold-and-resume gate for each populated or otherwise protected area. After a vehicle's tracking icon crosses a hold-and-resume gate, flight termination must occur as required by sections 417.113(d)(6).

\(b\) The hold-and-resume gate analysis must account for:

\(1\) *Overflight of a wholly contained populated or otherwise protected area.* A hold-and-resume gate must be a closed, continuous contour that encompasses any populated or otherwise protected area located wholly within the impact limit lines. The hold-and-resume gate must encompass a populated or otherwise protected area such that flight termination or breakup of the launch vehicle while the tracking icon is outside the gate would not cause hazardous debris or overpressure to endanger the populated or otherwise protected area.

\(2\) *Overflight of an uncontained populated or otherwise protected area.* A hold-and-resume gate must be a closed, continuous contour that encompasses any area in which flight termination is allowed to occur. The hold-and-resume gate must encompass all hazard areas such that flight termination or breakup of the launch vehicle while the vehicle's tracking icon is inside the gate would not cause hazardous debris or critical overpressure to endanger any populated or otherwise protected area.

### §417.219   Data loss flight time and planned safe flight state analyses.

\(a\) *General.* For each launch, a flight safety analysis must establish data loss flight times, as identified by paragraph (b) of this section, and a planned safe flight state to establish each flight termination rule that applies when launch vehicle tracking data is not available for use by the flight safety crew. Section 417.113(d) contains requirements for flight termination rules.

\(b\) *Data loss flight times.* A flight safety analysis must establish the shortest elapsed thrusting time during which a launch vehicle can move from normal flight to a condition where the launch vehicle's hazardous debris impact dispersion extends to any protected area as a data loss flight time. The analysis must establish a data loss flight time for all times along the nominal trajectory from liftoff through that point during nominal flight when the minimum elapsed thrusting time is no greater than the time it would take for a normal vehicle to reach the overflight gate, or the planned safe flight state established under paragraph (c) of this section, whichever occurs earlier.

\(c\) *Planned safe flight state.* For a launch vehicle that performs normally during all portions of flight, the planned safe flight state is the point during the nominal flight of a launch vehicle where:

\(1\) No launch vehicle component, debris, or hazard can impact or affect a populated or otherwise protected area for the remainder of the launch;

\(2\) The launch vehicle achieves orbital insertion; or

\(3\) The launch vehicle's state vector reaches a state where the absence of a flight safety system would not significantly increase the accumulated risk from debris impacts and maintains positive flight safety system control to the maximum extent feasible.

### §417.221   Time delay analysis.

\(a\) *General.* A flight safety analysis must include a time delay analysis that establishes the mean elapsed time between the violation of a flight termination rule and the time when the flight safety system is capable of terminating flight for use in establishing flight safety limits as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.213   Flight safety limits analysis.|§417.213]].

\(b\) *Analysis constraints.* A time delay analyses must determine a time delay distribution that accounts for the following:

\(1\) The variance of all time delays for each potential failure scenario, including but not limited to, the range of malfunction turn characteristics and the time of flight when the malfunction occurs;

\(2\) A flight safety official's decision and reaction time, including variation in human response time; and

\(3\) Flight termination hardware and software delays including all delays inherent in:

\(i\) Tracking systems;

\(ii\) Data processing systems, including all filter delays;

\(iii\) Display systems;

\(iv\) Command control systems; and

\(v\) Flight termination systems.

### §417.223   Flight hazard area analysis.

\(a\) *General.* A flight safety analysis must include a flight hazard area analysis that identifies any regions of land, sea, or air that must be surveyed, publicized, controlled, or evacuated in order to control the risk to the public from debris impact hazards. The risk management requirements of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.205   General.|§417.205]](a) apply. The analysis must account for, at a minimum:

\(1\) All trajectory times from liftoff to the planned safe flight state of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.219   Data loss flight time and planned safe flight state analyses.|§417.219]](c), including each planned impact, for an orbital launch, and through final impact for a suborbital launch;

\(2\) Regions of land potentially exposed to debris resulting from normal flight events and events resulting from any potential malfunction;

\(3\) Regions of sea and air potentially exposed to debris from normal flight events, including planned impacts;

\(4\) In the vicinity of the launch site, any waterborne vessels, populated offshore structures, or aircraft exposed to debris from events resulting from any potential abnormal flight events, including launch vehicle malfunction;

\(5\) Any operational controls implemented to control risk to the public from debris hazards;

\(6\) Debris identified by the debris analysis of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.211   Debris analysis.|§417.211]]; and

\(7\) All launch vehicle trajectory dispersion effects in the surface impact domain.

\(b\) Public notices. A flight hazard areas analysis must establish the ship hazard areas for notices to mariners that encompass the three-sigma impact dispersion area for each planned debris impact. A flight hazard areas analysis must establish the aircraft hazard areas for notices to airmen that encompass the 3-sigma impact dispersion volume for each planned debris impact. Section 417.121(e) contains procedural requirements for issuing notices to mariners and airmen.

### §417.224   Probability of failure analysis.

\(a\) *General.* All flight safety analyses for a launch, regardless of hazard or phase of flight, must account for launch vehicle failure probability in a consistent manner. A launch vehicle failure probability estimate must use accurate data, scientific principles, and a method that is statistically or probabilistically valid. For a launch vehicle with fewer than two flights, the failure probability estimate must account for the outcome of all previous launches of vehicles developed and launched in similar circumstances. For a launch vehicle with two or more flights, launch vehicle failure probability estimates must account for the outcomes of all previous flights of the vehicle in a statistically valid manner.

\(b\) *Failure.* For flight safety analysis purposes, a failure occurs when a launch vehicle does not complete any phase of normal flight or when any anomalous condition exhibits the potential for a stage or its debris to impact the Earth or reenter the atmosphere during the mission or any future mission of similar launch vehicle capability. Also, either a launch incident or launch accident constitutes a failure.

\(c\) *Previous flight.* For flight analysis purposes, flight begins at a time in which a launch vehicle normally or inadvertently lifts off from a launch platform. Lift-off occurs with any motion of the launch vehicle with respect to the launch platform.

### §417.225   Debris risk analysis.

A flight safety analysis must demonstrate that the risk to the public potentially exposed to inert and explosive debris hazards from any one flight of a launch vehicle satisfies the public risk criterion of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](b) for debris. A debris risk analysis must account for risk to populations on land, including regions of launch vehicle flight following passage through any gate in a flight safety limit established as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.217   Overflight gate analysis.|§417.217]]. A debris risk analysis must account for any potential casualties to the public as required by the debris thresholds and requirements of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](c).

### §417.227   Toxic release hazard analysis.

A flight safety analysis must establish flight commit criteria that protect the public from any hazard associated with toxic release and demonstrate compliance with the public risk criterion of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](b). The analysis must account for any toxic release that will occur during the proposed flight of a launch vehicle or that would occur in the event of a flight mishap. The analysis must account for any operational constraints and emergency procedures that provide protection from toxic release. The analysis must account for all members of the public that may be exposed to the toxic release, including all members of the public on land and on any waterborne vessels, populated offshore structures, and aircraft that are not operated in direct support of the launch.

### §417.229   Far-field overpressure blast effects analysis.

\(a\) *General.* A flight safety analysis must establish flight commit criteria that protect the public from any hazard associated with far field blast overpressure effects due to potential explosions during launch vehicle flight and demonstrate compliance with the public risk criterion of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](b).

\(b\) *Analysis constraints.* The analysis must account for:

\(1\) The potential for distant focus overpressure or overpressure enhancement given current meteorological conditions and terrain characteristics;

\(2\) The potential for broken windows due to peak incident overpressures below 1.0 psi and related casualties;

\(3\) The explosive capability of the launch vehicle at impact and at altitude and potential explosions resulting from debris impacts, including the potential for mixing of liquid propellants;

\(4\) Characteristics of the launch vehicle flight and the surroundings that would affect the population's susceptibility to injury, such as, shelter types and time of day of the proposed launch;

\(5\) Characteristics of the potentially affected windows, including their size, location, orientation, glazing material, and condition; and

\(6\) The hazard characteristics of the potential glass shards, such as falling from upper building stories or being propelled into or out of a shelter toward potentially occupied spaces.

[Link to an extension of the above amendment published at 86 FR 13448, Mar. 9, 2021.](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=4a24d322e7e2ad451d1f786b051cf52a&mc=true&node=20210309y1.1)

\(a\) *General.* A flight safety analysis must include a collision avoidance analysis that establishes each launch wait in a planned launch window during which a launch operator must not initiate flight, in order to protect any maned or mannable orbiting object. A launch operator must account for uncertainties associated with launch vehicle performance and timing and ensure that any calculated launch waits incorporate all additional time periods associated with such uncertainties. A launch operator must implement any launch waits as flight commit criteria according to [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.113   Launch safety rules.|§417.113]](c).

\(b\) *Orbital launch.* For an orbital launch, the analysis must establish any launch waits needed to ensure that the launch vehicle, any jettisoned components, and its payload do not pass closer than 200 kilometers to a manned or mannable orbiting object during ascent to initial orbital insertion through at least one complete orbit.

\(c\) *Suborbital launch.* For a suborbital launch, the analysis must establish any launch waits needed to ensure that the launch vehicle, any jettisoned components, and any payload do not pass closer than 200 kilometers to a manned or mannable orbital object throughout the flight.

\(d\) *Analysis not required.* A collision avoidance analysis is not required if the maximum altitude attainable by a launch operator's unguided suborbital launch vehicle is less than the altitude of the lowest manned or mannable orbiting object. The maximum altitude attainable must be obtained using an optimized trajectory, assuming 3-sigma maximum performance.

\[Docket No. FAA-2000-7953, 71 FR 50537, Aug. 25, 2006, as amended by Amdt. No. 417-5, 81 FR 59439, Aug. 30, 2016\]

### §417.233   Analysis for an unguided suborbital launch vehicle flown with a wind weighting safety system.

For each launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle flown with a wind weighting safety system, in addition to the other requirements in this subpart outlined in [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.201   Scope and applicability.|§417.201]](c), the flight safety analysis must:

\(b\) Establish any wind constraints under which launch may occur; and

\(c\) Include a wind weighting analysis that establishes the launcher azimuth and elevation settings that correct for the windcocking and wind-drift effects on the unguided suborbital launch vehicle.

## Subpart D—Flight Safety System

### §417.301   General.

\(a\) *Applicability.* This subpart applies to any flight safety system that a launch operator uses. The requirements of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](a) define when a launch operator must use a flight safety system. A launch operator must ensure that its flight safety system satisfies all the requirements of this subpart, including the referenced appendices. Paragraph (b) of this section provides an exception to this.

\(b\) *Alternate flight safety system.* A flight safety system need not satisfy one or more of the requirements of this subpart for a launch if a launch operator demonstrates, in accordance with [[Volume 4/B Procedure/0406 Investigations, enforcement, and administrative review.md#§406.3   Submissions; oral presentation in license, permit, and payload actions.|§406.3]](b), that the launch achieves an equivalent level of safety as a launch that satisfies all the requirements of this part. The flight safety system must undergo analysis and testing that is comparable to that required by this part to demonstrate that the system's reliability to perform each intended function is comparable to that required by this subpart.

\(c\) *Functions, subsystems, and components.* When initiated in the event of a launch vehicle failure, a flight safety system must prevent any launch vehicle hazard, including any payload hazard, from reaching a populated or other protected area. A flight safety system must consist of all of the following:

\(1\) A flight termination system that satisfies appendices D, E, and F of this part;

\(2\) A command control system that satisfies [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.303   Command control system requirements.|§§417.303]] and 417.305;

\(d\) *Compliance*—(1) *Non-Federal launch site.* For launch from a non-Federal launch site, any flight safety system, including all components, must:

\(i\) Comply with a launch operator's flight safety system compliance matrix of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0415 Launch license.md#§415.127   Flight safety system design and operation data.|§415.127]](g) that accounts for all the design, installation, and monitoring requirements of this subpart, including the referenced appendices; and

\(ii\) Comply with a launch operator's testing compliance matrix of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0415 Launch license.md#§415.129   Flight safety system test data.|§415.129]](b) that accounts for all the test requirements of this subpart, including the referenced appendices.

\(2\) *Federal launch range.* This provision applies to all sections of this subpart. The FAA will accept a flight safety system used or approved on a Federal launch range without need for further demonstration of compliance to the FAA if:

\(i\) A launch operator has contracted with a Federal launch range for the provision of flight safety system property and services; and

\(ii\) The FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that the Federal launch range's flight safety system property and services satisfy the requirements of this subpart. In this case, the FAA will treat the Federal launch range's flight safety system property and services as that of a launch operator.

\[Docket No. FAA-2000-7953, 71 FR 50537, Aug. 25, 2006, as amended by Amdt. No. 417-5, 81 FR 59439, Aug. 30, 2016\]

### §417.303   Command control system requirements.

\(a\) *General.* When initiated by a flight safety official, a command control system must transmit a command signal that has the radio frequency characteristics and power needed for receipt of the signal by the onboard vehicle flight termination system. A command control system must include all of the following:

\(1\) All flight termination system activation switches;

\(2\) All intermediate equipment, linkages, and software;

\(3\) Any auxiliary stations;

\(4\) Each command transmitter and transmitting antenna; and

\(5\) All support equipment that is critical for reliable operation, such as power, communications, and air conditioning systems.

\(b\) *Performance specifications.* A command control system and each subsystem, component, and part that can affect the reliability of a component must have written performance specifications that demonstrate, and contain the details of, how each satisfies the requirements of this section.

\(c\) *Reliability prediction.* A command control system must have a predicted reliability of 0.999 at the 95 percent confidence level when operating, starting with completion of the preflight testing and system verification of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.305   Command control system testing.|§417.305]](c) through initiation of flight and until the planned safe flight state for each launch. Any demonstration of the system's predicted reliability must satisfy [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.309   Flight safety system analysis.|§417.309]](b).

\(d\) *Fault tolerance.* A command control system must not contain any single-failure-point that, upon failure, would inhibit the required functioning of the system or cause the transmission of an undesired flight termination message. A command control system's design must ensure that the probability of transmitting an undesired or inadvertent command during flight is less than 1 × 10−7.

\(e\) *Configuration control.* A command control system must undergo configuration control to ensure its reliability and compatibility with the flight termination system used for each launch.

\(f\) *Electromagnetic interference.* Each command control system component must function within the electromagnetic environment to which it is exposed. A command control system must include protection to prevent interference from inhibiting the required functioning of the system or causing the transmission of an undesired or inadvertent flight termination command. Any susceptible remote control data processing or transmitting system that is part of the command control system must prevent electromagnetic interference.

\(g\) *Command transmitter failover.* A command control system must include independent, redundant transmitter systems that automatically switch, or “fail-over,” from a primary transmitter to a secondary transmitter when a condition exists that indicates potential failure of the primary transmitter. The switch must be automatic and provide all the same command control system capabilities through the secondary transmitter system. The secondary transmitter system must respond to any transmitter system configuration and radio message orders established for the launch. The fail-over criteria that trigger automatic switching from the primary transmitter to the secondary transmitter must account for each of the following transmitter performance parameters and failure indicators:

\(1\) Low transmitter power;

\(2\) Center frequency shift;

\(3\) Out of tolerance tone frequency;

\(4\) Out of tolerance message timing;

\(5\) Loss of communication between central control and transmitter site;

\(6\) Central control commanded status and site status disagree;

\(7\) Transmitter site fails to respond to a configuration or radiation order within a specified period of time; and

\(8\) For a tone-based system, tone deviation and tone imbalance.

\(h\) *Switching between transmitter systems.* Any manual or automatic switching between transmitter systems, including fail-over, must not result in the radio carrier being off the air long enough for any command destruct system to be captured by an unauthorized transmitter. The time the radio carrier is off the air must account for any loss of carrier and any simultaneous multiple radio carrier transmissions from two transmitter sites during switching.

\(i\) *Radio carrier.* For each launch, a command control system must provide all of the following:

\(1\) The radio frequency signal and radiated power density that each command destruct system needs to activate during flight;

\(2\) The 12-dB power density margin required by section D417.9(d) of appendix D of this part under nominal conditions; and

\(3\) A 6-dB power density margin under worst-case conditions.

\(j\) *Command control system monitoring and control.* A command control system must provide for monitoring and control of the system from the flight safety system displays and controls required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.307   Support systems.|§417.307]](f), including real-time selection of a transmitter, transmitter site, communication circuits, and antenna configuration.

\(k\) *Command transmitter system.* For each launch, a command transmitter system must:

\(1\) Transmit signals that are compatible with any command destruct system's radio frequency receiving system of section D417.25 and command receiver decoder of section D417.29 of appendix D of this part;

\(2\) Ensure that all arm and destruct commands transmitted to a flight termination system have priority over any other commands transmitted;

## Subpart E—Ground Safety

### §417.401   Scope.

This subpart contains public safety requirements that apply to launch processing and post-launch operations at a launch site in the United States. Ground safety requirements in this subpart apply to activities performed by, or on behalf of, a launch operator at a launch site in the United States. A licensed launch site operator must satisfy the requirements of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0420 License to operate a launch site.md|part 420 of this chapter]].

### §417.402   Compliance.

\(a\) *General.* A launch operator's ground safety process must satisfy this subpart.

\(b\) *Ground safety analysis conducted for launch at a Federal launch range.* This provision applies to all sections of this subpart. The FAA will accept a ground safety process conducted for a launch from a Federal launch range without need for further demonstration of compliance to the FAA if:

\(1\) A launch operator has contracted with a Federal launch range for the provision of the ground safety process; and

\(2\) The FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that the Federal launch range's ground safety process satisfies the requirements of this subpart. In this case, the FAA will treat the Federal launch range's process as that of a launch operator.

\(c\) *Toxic release hazard analysis conducted for launch processing at a Federal launch range.* The FAA will accept a toxic release hazard analysis conducted for launch processing from a Federal launch range provided the toxic release analysis satisfies the Federal launch range's requirements, and the FAA has assessed the Federal launch range, through its launch site safety assessment, and found that the applicable Federal launch range safety-related launch services and property satisfy the requirements of this subpart.

\(d\) *Demonstration of compliance.* For a licensed launch that does not satisfy paragraphs (b) and (c) of this section, a launch operator must demonstrate compliance to the FAA with the requirements of this subpart, and must include in its demonstration the analysis products required by subparts A and E of this part, and appendices I and J of this part.

\(e\) *Alternate methods.* The FAA will approve an alternate hazard control method if a launch operator demonstrates, in accordance with [[Volume 4/B Procedure/0406 Investigations, enforcement, and administrative review.md#§406.3   Submissions; oral presentation in license, permit, and payload actions.|§406.3]](b), that its proposed hazard control method provides an equivalent level of safety to that required by this subpart.

### §417.403   General.

\(a\) *Public safety.* A launch operator must ensure that each hazard control is in place to protect the public from each potential hazard associated with launch processing and post-launch operations.

\(b\) *Ground safety analysis.* A launch operator must perform and document a ground safety analysis that satisfies [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.405   Ground safety analysis.|§417.405]] and appendix J of this part.

\(c\) *Local agreements.* A launch operator must coordinate and perform launch processing and post-launch operations that satisfy local agreements to ensure the responsibilities and requirements in this part and [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0420 License to operate a launch site.md#§420.57   Notifications.|§420.57]] of this chapter are met. A launch operator, when using a launch site of a licensed launch site operator, must coordinate the launch operator's operations with the launch site operator and with any agreements that the launch site operator has with local authorities that form a basis for the launch site operator's license.

\(d\) *Launch operator's exclusive use of a launch site.* For a launch conducted from a launch site exclusive to its own use, a launch operator must satisfy the requirements of this subpart and of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0420 License to operate a launch site.md|part 420 of this chapter]], including subpart D of part 420.

### §417.405   Ground safety analysis.

\(a\) A launch operator must perform a ground safety analysis for launch vehicle hardware, ground hardware including launch site and ground support equipment, launch processing, and post-launch operations at a launch site in the United States. The requirements of this section apply to the performance of the ground safety analysis and to the ground safety analysis products that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.402   Compliance.|§417.402]](d). This analysis must identify each potential hazard, each associated cause, and each hazard control that a launch operator must establish and maintain to keep each identified hazard from affecting the public. A launch operator must incorporate the launch site operator's systems and operations involved in ensuring public safety into the ground safety analysis.

\(b\) Technical personnel who are knowledgeable of launch vehicle systems, launch processing, ground systems, operations, and their associated hazards must prepare the ground safety analysis. These individuals must be qualified to perform the ground safety analysis through training, education, and experience.

\(c\) A launch operator must ensure personnel performing a ground safety analysis or preparing a ground safety analysis report will have the cooperation of the entire launch operator's organization. A launch operator must maintain supporting documentation and it must be available upon request.

\(d\) A launch operator must:

\(1\) Begin a ground safety analysis by identifying the systems and operations to be analyzed;

\(2\) Define the extent of each system and operation being assessed to ensure there is no miscommunication as to what the hazards are, and who, in a launch operator's organization or other organization supporting the launch, controls those hazards; and

\(3\) Ensure that the ground safety analysis accounts for each launch vehicle system and operation involved in launch processing and post-launch operations, even if only to show that no hazard exists.

\(e\) A ground safety analysis need not account for potential hazards of a component if a launch operator demonstrates that no hazard to the public exists at the system level. A ground safety analysis need not account for an operation's individual task or subtask level if a launch operator demonstrates that no hazard to the public exists at the operation level. A launch operator must provide verifiable controls for hazards that are confined within the boundaries of a launch operator's facility to ensure the public will not have access to the associated hazard area while the hazard exists.

\(f\) A launch operator must identify each potential hazard, including non-credible hazards. The probability of occurrence is not relevant with respect to identifying a hazard. Where an assertion is made that no hazard exists for a particular system or operation, the ground safety analysis must provide the rationale. A launch operator must identify the following hazards of each launch vehicle system, launch site and ground support equipment, launch processing, and post-launch operations:

\(1\) System hazards, including explosives and other ordnance, solid and liquid propellants, toxic and radioactive materials, asphyxiants, cryogens, and high pressure. System hazards generally exist even when no operation is occurring; and

\(2\) Operation hazards derived from an unsafe condition created by a system, operating environment, or an unsafe act.

\(g\) A launch operator must categorize identified system and operation hazards as follows:

\(1\) *Public hazard.* A hazard that extends beyond the launch location under the control of a launch operator. Public hazards include the following:

\(i\) Blast overpressure and fragmentation resulting from an explosion;

\(ii\) Fire and deflagration, including hazardous materials such as radioactive material, beryllium, carbon fibers, and propellants. A launch operator must assume that in the event of a fire, hazardous smoke from systems containing hazardous materials will reach the public;

\(iii\) Sudden release of a hazardous material into the air, water, or ground; and

\(iv\) Inadvertent ignition of a propulsive launch vehicle payload, stage, or motor.

\(2\) *Launch location hazard.* A hazard that stays within the confines of the location under the control of a launch operator but extends beyond individuals doing the work. The confines may be bounded by a wall or a fence line of a facility or launch complex, or by a fenced or unfenced boundary of an entire industrial complex or multi-user launch site. A launch location hazard may affect the public depending on public access controls. Launch location hazards that may affect the public include the hazards listed in paragraphs (g)(1)(i)-(iv) of this section and additional hazards in potentially unsafe locations accessible to the public such as:

\(i\) Unguarded electrical circuits or machinery;

\(ii\) Oxygen deficient environments;

\(iii\) Falling objects;

\(iv\) Potential falls into unguarded pits or from unguarded elevated work platforms; and

\(v\) Sources of ionizing and non-ionizing radiation such as x-rays, radio transmitters, and lasers.

\(3\) *Employee hazard.* A hazard to individuals performing a launch operator's work, but not to other people in the area. A launch operator must comply with all applicable Federal, state, and local employee safety regulations. A launch operator's ground safety analysis must identify employee hazards and demonstrate that there are no associated public safety issues.

\(4\) *Non-credible hazard.* A hazard for which possible adverse effects on people or property would be negligible and where the possibility of adverse effects on people or property is remote. A launch operator's ground safety analysis must identify non-credible hazards and demonstrate that the hazard is non-credible.

\(h\) A ground safety analysis must identify each hazard cause for each public hazard and launch location hazard. The ground safety analysis must account for conditions, acts, or chain of events that can result in a hazard. The ground safety analysis must account for the possible failure of any control or monitoring circuitry within hardware systems that can cause a hazard.

\(i\) A ground safety analysis must identify the hazard controls to be established by a launch operator for each hazard cause identified in paragraph (h) of this section. A launch operator's hazard controls include the use of engineering controls for the containment of hazards within defined areas and the control of public access to those areas.

\(j\) A launch operator must verify all information in a ground safety analysis, including design margins, fault tolerance and successful completion of tests. A launch operator must:

\(1\) Trace any identified hardware to an engineering drawing or other document that describes hardware configuration;

\(2\) Trace any test or analysis used in developing the ground safety analysis to a report or memorandum that describes how the test or analysis was performed;

\(3\) Ensure the accuracy of the test or analysis and the associated results;

\(4\) Trace any procedural hazard control identified to a written procedure, and approved by the person designated under [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.103   Safety organization.|§417.103]](b)(2) or the person's designee, with the paragraph or step number of the procedure specified;

\(5\) Identify a verifiable hazard control for each hazard; if a hazard control is not verifiable, a launch operator may include it as an informational note on the hazard analysis form;

\(6\) For each hazard control, reference a released drawing, report, procedure or other document that verifies the existence of the hazard control; and

\(7\) Maintain records, as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.15   Records.|§417.15]], of the documentation that verifies the information in the ground safety analysis.

\(k\) A launch operator must ensure the continuing accuracy of its ground safety analysis. The analysis of systems and operations must not end upon submission of a ground safety analysis report to the FAA during the license application process. A launch operator must analyze each new or modified system or operation for potential hazards that can affect the public. A launch operator must ensure that each existing system and operation is subject to continual scrutiny and that the information in a ground safety analysis report is kept current.

\(2\) An ordnance system must provide for safing and arming of the ordnance. An electrically initiated ordnance system must include ordnance initiation devices and arming devices, also referred to as safe and arm devices, that provide a removable and replaceable mechanical barrier or other positive means of interrupting power to each ordnance firing circuit to prevent inadvertent initiation of ordnance. A mechanical safe and arm device must have a safing pin that locks the mechanical barrier in a safe position. A mechanical actuated ordnance device must also have a safing pin that prevents mechanical movement within the device. A launch operator must comply with section D417.13 of this part for specific safing and arming requirements for a flight termination system;

\(3\) Protect ordnance systems from stray energy through grounding, bonding, and shielding; and

\(4\) Current limit any monitoring or test circuitry that interfaces with an ordnance system to protect against inadvertent initiation of ordnance.

\(2\) A launch operator must establish a safety clear zone when the launch vehicle is in a launch command configuration with the flight safety systems fully operational and on internal power.

\(b\) A launch operator must establish restrictions that prohibit public access to a safety clear zone during a hazardous operation. A safety clear zone may extend to areas beyond the launch location boundaries if local agreements provide for restricting public access to such areas and a launch operator verifies that the safety clear zone is clear of the public during the hazardous operation.

\(c\) A launch operator's procedures must verify that the public is outside of a safety clear zone prior to a launch operator beginning a hazardous operation.

\(d\) A launch operator must control a safety clear zone to ensure no public access during the hazardous operation. Safety clear zone controls include:

### §417.413   Hazard areas.

\(a\) *General.* A launch operator must define a hazard area that confines the adverse effects of a hardware system should an event occur that presents a public hazard or launch location hazard. A launch operator must prohibit public access to the hazard area whenever a hazard is present unless the requirements for public access of paragraph (b) of this section are met.

\(b\) *Public access.* A launch operator must establish a process for authorizing public access if visitors or members of the public must have access to a launch operator's facility or launch location. The process must ensure that each member of the public is briefed on the hazards within the facility and related safety warnings, procedures, and rules that provide protection, or a launch operator must ensure that each member of the public is accompanied by a knowledgeable escort.

\(c\) *Hazard controls during public access.* A launch operator must establish procedural controls that prevent hazardous operations from taking place while members of the public have access to the launch location and must verify that system hazard controls are in place that prevent initiation of a hazardous event. Hazard controls and procedures that prevent initiation of a hazardous event include the following:

\(1\) Use of lockout devices or other restraints on system actuation switches or other controls to eliminate the possibility of inadvertent actuation of a hazardous system.

\(2\) Disconnect ordnance systems from power sources, incorporate the use of safing plugs, or have safety devices in place that prevent inadvertent initiation. Activity involving the control circuitry of electrically activated safety devices must not be ongoing while the public has access to the hazard area. Install safing pins on safe and arm devices and mechanically actuated devices. Disconnect explosive transfer lines, not protected by a safe and arm device or a mechanically actuated device or equivalent.

\(3\) When systems or tanks are loaded with hypergols or other toxic materials, close the system or tank and verify it is leak-tight with two verifiable closures, such as a valve and a cap, to every external flow path or fitting. Such a system must also be in a steady-state condition.

\(4\) Keep each pressurized system below its maximum allowable working pressure and do not allow it to be in a dynamic state. Activity involving the control circuitry of electrically activated pressure system valves must not be ongoing while the public has access to the associated hazard area.

\(i\) Potential falling objects;

\(ii\) Falls from an elevated height; and

\(iii\) Protection from potentially hazardous vents, such as pressure relief discharge vents.

\(7\) Maintain and verify that safety devices or safety critical systems are operating properly prior to permitting public access.

### §417.415   Post-launch and post-flight-attempt hazard controls.

\(a\) A launch operator must establish, maintain and perform procedures for controlling hazards and returning the launch facility to a safe condition after a successful launch. Procedural hazard controls must include:

\(1\) Provisions for extinguishing fires;

\(2\) Re-establishing full operational capability of safety devices, barriers, and platforms; and

\(3\) Access control.

\(b\) A launch operator must establish procedures for controlling hazards associated with a failed flight attempt where a solid or liquid launch vehicle engine start command was sent, but the launch vehicle did not liftoff. These procedures must include the following:

\(1\) Maintaining and verifying that each flight termination system remains operational until verification that the launch vehicle does not represent a risk of inadvertent liftoff. If an ignition signal has been sent to a solid rocket motor, the flight termination system must remain armed and active for a period of no less than 30 minutes. During this time, flight termination system batteries must maintain sufficient voltage and current capacity for flight termination system operation. The flight termination system receivers must remain captured by the command control system transmitter's carrier signal;

\(2\) Assuring that the vehicle is in a safe configuration, including its propulsion and ordnance systems. The flight safety system crew must have access to the vehicle status. Re-establish safety devices and bring each pressurized system down to safe pressure levels; and

\(3\) Prohibiting launch complex entry until the launch pad area safing procedures are complete.

\(c\) A launch operator must establish procedural controls for hazards associated with an unsuccessful flight where the launch vehicle has a land or water impact. These procedures must include the following provisions:

\(2\) Extinguishing fires;

\(3\) Securing impact areas to ensure that personnel and the public are evacuated, and ensure that no unauthorized personnel or members of the public enter, and to preserve evidence; and

\(4\) Ensuring public safety from hazardous debris, such as plans for recovery and salvage of launch vehicle debris and safe disposal of hazardous materials.

### §417.417   Propellants and explosives.

\(a\) A launch operator must comply with the explosive safety criteria in [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0420 License to operate a launch site.md|part 420 of this chapter]].

\(d\) A launch operator must establish and maintain each procedural system control to prevent inadvertent initiation of propellants and explosives. These controls must include the following:

\(1\) Protect ordnance systems from stray energy through methods of bonding, grounding, and shielding, and controlling radio frequency radiation sources in a radio frequency radiation exclusion area. A launch operator must determine the vulnerability of its electro-explosive devices and systems to radio frequency radiation and establish radio frequency radiation power limits or radio frequency radiation exclusion areas as required by the launch site operator or to ensure safety.

\(2\) Keep ordnance safety devices, as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.409   System hazard controls.|§417.409]], in place until the launch complex is cleared as part of the final launch countdown.

[Link to an amendment published at 85 FR 79716, Dec. 10, 2020.](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=4a24d322e7e2ad451d1f786b051cf52a&mc=true&node=20201210y1.50)

[Link to an extension of the above amendment published at 86 FR 13448, Mar. 9, 2021.](https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=4a24d322e7e2ad451d1f786b051cf52a&mc=true&node=20210309y1.1)

# A417.1   Scope

The requirements of this appendix apply to the methods for performing the flight safety analysis required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](f) and subpart C of this part. The methodologies contained in this appendix provide an acceptable means of satisfying the requirements of subpart C and provide a standard and a measure of fidelity against which the FAA will measure any proposed alternative analysis approach. This appendix also identifies the analysis products that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§417.203]](e).

# A417.3   Applicability

The requirements of this appendix apply to a launch operator and the launch operator's flight safety analysis unless the launch operator clearly and convincingly demonstrates that an alternative approach provides an equivalent level of safety. If a Federal launch range performs the launch operator's analysis, [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§417.203]](d) applies. Section A417.33 applies to the flight of any unguided suborbital launch vehicle that uses a wind-weighting safety system. All other sections of this appendix apply to the flight of any launch vehicle required to use a flight safety system as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](a). For any alternative flight safety system approved by the FAA as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.301   General.|§417.301]](b), the FAA will determine the applicability of this appendix during the licensing process.

# A417.5   General

A launch operator's flight safety analysis must satisfy the requirements for public risk management and the requirements for the compatibility of the input and output of dependent analyses of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.205   General.|§417.205]].

# A417.7   Trajectory

\(a\) *General.* A flight safety analysis must include a trajectory analysis that satisfies the requirements of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.207   Trajectory analysis.|§417.207]]. This section applies to the computation of each of the trajectories required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.207   Trajectory analysis.|§417.207]] and to each trajectory analysis product that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§417.203]](e).

\(b\) *Wind standards.* A trajectory analysis must incorporate wind data in accordance with the following:

\(1\) For each launch, a trajectory analysis must produce ”with-wind” launch vehicle trajectories pursuant to paragraph (f)(6) of this section and do so using composite wind profiles for the month that the launch will take place or composite wind profiles that are as severe or more severe than the winds for the month that the launch will take place.

\(2\) A composite wind profile used for the trajectory analysis must have a cumulative percentile frequency that represents wind conditions that are at least as severe as the worst wind conditions under which flight would be attempted for purposes of achieving the launch operator's mission. These worst wind conditions must account for the launch vehicle's ability to operate normally in the presence of wind and accommodate any flight safety limit constraints.

\(c\) *Nominal trajectory.* A trajectory analysis must produce a nominal trajectory that describes a launch vehicle's flight path, position and velocity, where all vehicle aerodynamic parameters are as expected, all vehicle internal and external systems perform exactly as planned, and no external perturbing influences other than atmospheric drag and gravity affect the launch vehicle.

\(d\) *Dispersed trajectories.* A trajectory analysis must produce the following dispersed trajectories and describe the distribution of a launch vehicle's position and velocity as a function of winds and performance error parameters in the uprange, downrange, left-crossrange and right-crossrange directions.

\(1\) *Three-sigma maximum and minimum performance trajectories.* A trajectory analysis must produce a three-sigma maximum performance trajectory that provides the maximum downrange distance of the instantaneous impact point for any given time after lift-off. A trajectory analysis must produce a three-sigma minimum performance trajectory that provides the minimum downrange distance of the instantaneous impact point for any given time after lift-off. For any time after lift-off, the instantaneous impact point dispersion of a normally performing launch vehicle must lie between the extremes achieved at that time after lift-off by the three-sigma maximum and three-sigma minimum performance trajectories. The three-sigma maximum and minimum performance trajectories must account for wind and performance error parameter distributions as follows:

\(i\) For each three-sigma maximum and minimum performance trajectory, the analysis must use composite head wind and composite tail wind profiles that represent the worst wind conditions under which a launch would be attempted as required by paragraph (b) of this section.

\(ii\) Each three-sigma maximum and minimum performance trajectory must account for all launch vehicle performance error parameters identified as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section that have an effect upon instantaneous impact point range.

\(2\) *Three-sigma left and right lateral trajectories.* A trajectory analysis must produce a three-sigma left lateral trajectory that provides the maximum left crossrange distance of the instantaneous impact point for any time after lift-off. A trajectory analysis must produce a three-sigma right lateral trajectory that provides the maximum right crossrange distance of the instantaneous impact point for any time after lift-off. For any time after lift-off, the instantaneous impact point dispersion of a normally performing launch vehicle must lie between the extremes achieved at that time after liftoff by the three-sigma left lateral and three-sigma right lateral performance trajectories. The three-sigma lateral performance trajectories must account for wind and performance error parameter distributions as follows:

\(i\) In producing each left and right lateral trajectory, the analysis must use composite left and composite right lateral-wind profiles that represent the worst wind conditions under which a launch would be attempted as required by paragraph (b) of this section.

\(ii\) The three-sigma left and right lateral trajectories must account for all launch vehicle performance error parameters identified as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section that have an effect on the lateral deviation of the instantaneous impact point.

\(3\) *Fuel-exhaustion trajectory.* A trajectory analysis must produce a fuel-exhaustion trajectory for the launch of any launch vehicle with a final suborbital stage that will terminate thrust nominally without burning to fuel exhaustion. The analysis must produce the trajectory that would occur if the planned thrust termination of the final suborbital stage did not occur. The analysis must produce a fuel-exhaustion trajectory that extends either the nominal trajectory taken through fuel exhaustion of the last suborbital stage or the three-sigma maximum trajectory taken through fuel exhaustion of the last suborbital stage, whichever produces an instantaneous impact point with the greatest range for any time after liftoff.

If any stage burn time lasts less than four seconds, the time intervals must not exceed 0.2 seconds. The launch operator must provide the temporal trajectory data from launch up to a point in flight when effective thrust of the final stage terminates, or to thrust termination of the stage or burn that places the vehicle in orbit. For an unguided sub-orbital launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, the launch operator must provide these data for each nominal quadrant launcher elevation angle and payload weight. The launch operator must provide these data on paper in text format and electronically in ASCII text, space delimited format.

The roll axis is a line identical to the launch vehicle's longitudinal axis with its origin at the nominal center of gravity positive towards the vehicle nose. The roll plane is normal to the roll axis at the vehicle's nominal center of gravity. The yaw axis and the pitch axis are any two orthogonal axes lying in the roll plane. The launch operator must provide roll, pitch and yaw axes of right-handed systems so that, when looking along the roll axis toward the nose, a clockwise rotation around the roll axis will send the pitch axis toward the yaw axis. The right-handed system must be oriented so that the yaw axis is positive in the downrange direction while in the vertical position (roll axis upward from surface) or positive at an angle of 180 degrees to the downrange direction. The axis may be related to the vehicle's normal orientation with respect to the vehicle's trajectory but, once defined, remain fixed with respect to the vehicle's body. The launch operator must indicate the positive direction of the yaw axis chosen. The analysis products must present the direction cosines using the EFG reference system described in paragraph (g)(7)(iv) of this section.

\(iii\) *X, Y, Z, XD, YD, ZD trajectory coordinates.* A launch operator must provide the launch vehicle position coordinates (X, Y, Z) and velocity magnitudes (XD, YD, ZD) referenced to an orthogonal, Earth-fixed, right-handed coordinate system. The XY plane must be tangent to the ellipsoidal Earth at the origin, which must coincide with the launch point. The positive X-axis must coincide with the launch azimuth.

# A417.9   Malfunction turn

\(a\) *General.* A flight safety analysis must include a malfunction turn analysis that satisfies the requirements of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.209   Malfunction turn analysis.|§417.209]]. This section applies to the computation of the malfunction turns and the production of turn data required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.209   Malfunction turn analysis.|§417.209]] and to the malfunction turn analysis products that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§417.203]](e).

\(b\) *Malfunction turn analysis constraints.* The following constraints apply to a malfunction turn analysis:

\(1\) The analysis must produce malfunction turns that start at a given malfunction start time. The turn must last no less than 12 seconds. These duration limits apply regardless of whether or not the vehicle would breakup or tumble before the prescribed duration of the turn.

\(2\) A malfunction turn analysis must account for the thrusting periods of flight along a nominal trajectory beginning at first motion until thrust termination of the final thrusting stage or until the launch vehicle achieves orbit, whichever occurs first.

\(3\) A malfunction turn must consist of a 90-degree turn or a turn in both the pitch and yaw planes that would produce the largest deviation from the nominal instantaneous impact point of which the launch vehicle is capable at any time during the malfunction turn as required by paragraph (d) of this section.

\(4\) The first malfunction turn must start at liftoff. The analysis must account for subsequent malfunction turns initiated at regular nominal trajectory time intervals not to exceed four seconds.

\(5\) A malfunction turn analysis must produce malfunction turn data for time intervals of no less than one second over the duration of each malfunction turn.

\(6\) The analysis must assume that the launch vehicle performance is nominal up to the point of the malfunction that produces the turn.

\(7\) A malfunction turn analysis must not account for the effects of gravity.

\(8\) A malfunction turn analysis must ensure the tumble turn envelope curve maintains a positive slope throughout the malfunction turn duration as illustrated in figure A417.9-1. When calculating a tumble turn for an aerodynamically unstable launch vehicle, in the high aerodynamic region it often turns out that no matter how small the initial deflection of the rocket engine, the airframe tumbles through 180 degrees, or one-half cycle, in less time than the required turn duration period. In such a case, the analysis must use a 90-degree turn as the malfunction turn.

\(c\) *Failure modes.* A malfunction turn analysis must account for the significant failure modes that result in a thrust vector offset from the nominal state. If a malfunction turn at a malfunction start time can occur as a function of more than one failure mode, the analysis must account for the failure mode that causes the most rapid and largest launch vehicle instantaneous impact point deviation.

\(d\) *Type of malfunction turn.* A malfunction turn analysis must establish the maximum turning capability of a launch vehicle's velocity vector during each malfunction turn by accounting for a 90-degree turn to estimate the vehicle's turning capability or by accounting for trim turns and tumble turns in both the pitch and yaw planes to establish the vehicle's turning capability. When establishing the turning capability of a launch vehicle's velocity vector, the analysis must account for each turn as follows:

\(1\) *90-degree turn.* A 90-degree turn must constitute a turn produced at the malfunction start time by instantaneously re-directing and maintaining the vehicle's thrust at 90 degrees to the velocity vector, without regard for how this situation can be brought about.

\(2\) *Pitch turn.* A pitch turn must constitute the angle turned by the launch vehicle's total velocity vector in the pitch-plane. The velocity vector's pitch-plane must be the two dimensional surface that includes the launch vehicle's yaw-axis and the launch vehicle's roll-axis.

\(3\) *Yaw turn.* A yaw turn must constitute the angle turned by the launch vehicle's total velocity vector in the lateral plane. The velocity vector's lateral plane must be the two dimensional surface that includes the launch vehicle's pitch axis and the launch vehicle's total velocity.

\(4\) *Trim turn.* A trim turn must constitute a turn where a launch vehicle's thrust moment balances the aerodynamic moment while a constant rotation rate is imparted to the launch vehicle's longitudinal axis. The analysis must account for a maximum-rate trim turn made at or near the greatest angle of attack that can be maintained while the aerodynamic moment is balanced by the thrust moment, whether the vehicle is stable or unstable.

\(5\) *Tumble turn.* A tumble turn must constitute a turn that results if the launch vehicle's airframe rotates in an uncontrolled fashion, at an angular rate that is brought about by a thrust vector offset angle, and if the offset angle is held constant throughout the turn. The analysis must account for a series of tumble turns, each turn with a different thrust vector offset angle, that are plotted on the same graph for each malfunction start time.

\(6\) *Turn envelope.* A turn envelope must constitute a curve on a tumble turn graph that has tangent points to each individual tumble turn curve computed for each malfunction start time. The curve must envelope the actual tumble turn curves to predict tumble turn angles for each area between the calculated turn curves. Figure A417.9-1 depicts a series of tumble turn curves and the tumble turn envelope curve.

\(7\) *Malfunction turn capabilities.* When not using a 90-degree turn, a malfunction turn analysis must establish the launch vehicle maximum turning capability as required by the following malfunction turn constraints:

\(i\) *Launch vehicle stable at all angles of attack.* If a launch vehicle is so stable that the maximum thrust moment that the vehicle could experience cannot produce tumbling, but produces a maximum-rate trim turn at some angle of attack less than 90 degrees, the analysis must produce a series of trim turns, including the maximum-rate trim turn, by varying the initial thrust vector offset at the beginning of the turn. If the maximum thrust moment results in a maximum-rate trim turn at some angle of attack greater than 90 degrees, the analysis must produce a series of trim turns for angles of attack up to and including 90 degrees.

\(ii\) *Launch vehicle aerodynamically unstable at all angles of attack.* If flying a trim turn is not possible even for a period of only a few seconds, the malfunction turn analysis need only establish tumble turns. Otherwise, the malfunction turn analysis must establish a series of trim turns, including the maximum-rate trim turn, and the family of tumble turns.

\(iii\) *Launch vehicle unstable at low angles of attack but stable at some higher angles of attack.* If large engine deflections result in tumbling, and small engine deflections do not, the analysis must produce a series of trim and tumble turns as required by paragraph (d)(7)(ii) of this section for launch vehicles aerodynamically unstable at all angles of attack. If both large and small constant engine deflections result in tumbling, regardless of how small the deflection might be, the analysis must account for the malfunction turn capabilities achieved at the stability angle of attack, assuming no upsetting thrust moment, and must account for the turns achieved by a tumbling vehicle.

\(e\) *Malfunction turn analysis products.* The products of a malfunction turn analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA include:

\(1\) A description of the assumptions, techniques, and equations used in deriving the malfunction turns.

\(2\) A set of sample calculations for at least one flight hazard area malfunction start time and one downrange malfunction start time. The sample computation for the downrange malfunction must start at a time at least 50 seconds after the flight hazard area malfunction start time or at the time of nominal thrust termination of the final stage minus the malfunction turn duration.

\(3\) A launch operator must file malfunction turn data in electronic tabular and graphic formats. The graphs must use scale factors such that the plotting and reading accuracy do not degrade the accuracy of the data. For each malfunction turn start time, a graph must use the same time scales for the malfunction velocity vector turn angle and malfunction velocity magnitude plot pairs. A launch operator must provide tabular listings of the data used to generate the graphs in digital ASCII file format. A launch operator must file the data items required in this paragraph for each malfunction start time and for time intervals that do not exceed one second for the duration of each malfunction turn.

\(i\) *Velocity turn angle graphs.* A launch operator must file a velocity turn angle graph for each malfunction start time. For each velocity turn angle graph, the ordinate axis must represent the total angle turned by the velocity vector, and the abscissa axis must represent the time duration of the turn and must show increments not to exceed one second. The series of tumble turns must include the envelope of all tumble turn curves. The tumble turn envelope must represent the tumble turn capability for all possible constant thrust vector offset angles. Each tumble turn curve selected to define the envelope must appear on the same graph as the envelope. A launch operator must file a series of trim turn curves for representative values of thrust vector offset. The series of trim turn curves must include the maximum rate trim turn. Figure A417.9-1 depicts an example family of tumble turn curves and the tumble turn velocity vector envelope.

\(ii\) *Velocity magnitude graphs.* A launch operator must file a velocity magnitude graph for each malfunction start time. For each malfunction velocity magnitude graph, the ordinate axis must represent the magnitude of the velocity vector and the abscissa axis must represent the time duration of the turn. Each graph must show the abscissa divided into increments not to exceed one second. Each graph must show the total velocity magnitude plotted as a function of time starting with the malfunction start time for each thrust vector offset used to define the corresponding velocity turn-angle curve. A launch operator must provide a corresponding velocity magnitude curve for each velocity tumble turn angle curve and each velocity trim-turn angle curve. For each individual tumble turn curve selected to define the tumble turn envelope, the corresponding velocity magnitude graph must show the individual tumble turn curve's point of tangency to the envelope. The point of tangency must consist of the point where the tumble turn envelope is tangent to an individual tumble turn curve produced with a discrete thrust vector offset angle. A launch operator must transpose the points of tangency to the velocity magnitude curves by plotting a point on the velocity magnitude curve at the same time point where tangency occurs on the corresponding velocity tumble-turn angle curve. Figure A417.9-2 depicts an example tumble turn velocity magnitude curve.

\(iii\) *Vehicle orientation.* The launch operator must file tabular or graphical data for the vehicle orientation in the form of roll, pitch, and yaw angular orientation of the vehicle longitudinal axis as a function of time into the turn for each turn initiation time. Angular orientation of a launch vehicle's longitudinal axis is illustrated in figures A417.9-3 and A417.9-4.

\(iv\) *Onset conditions.* A launch operator must provide launch vehicle state information for each malfunction start time. This state data must include the launch vehicle thrust, weight, velocity magnitude and pad-centered topocentric X, Y, Z, XD, YD, ZD state vector.

\(v\) *Breakup information.* A launch operator must specify whether its launch vehicle will remain intact throughout each malfunction turn. If the launch vehicle will break up during a turn, the launch operator must identify the time for launch vehicle breakup on each velocity magnitude graph. The launch operator must show the time into the turn at which vehicle breakup would occur as either a specific value or a probability distribution for time until breakup.

\(vi\) *Inflection point.* A launch operator must identify the inflection point on each tumble turn envelope curve and maximum rate trim turn curve for each malfunction start time as illustrated in figure A417.9-1. The inflection point marks the point in time during the turn where the slope of the curve stops increasing and begins to decrease or, in other words, the point were the concavity of the curve changes from concave up to concave down. The inflection point on a malfunction turn curve must identify the time in the malfunction turn that the launch vehicle body achieves a 90-degree rotation from the nominal position. On a tumble turn curve the inflection point must represent the start of the launch vehicle tumble.

\(b\) *Debris analysis constraints.* A debris analysis must produce the debris model described in paragraph (c) of this section. The analysis must account for all launch vehicle debris fragments, individually or in groupings of fragments called classes. The characteristics of each debris fragment represented by a class must be similar enough to the characteristics of all the other debris fragments represented by that class that all the debris fragments of the class can be described by a single set of characteristics. Paragraph (c)(10) of this section applies when establishing a debris class. A debris model must describe the physical, aerodynamic, and harmful characteristics of each debris fragment either individually or as a member of a class. A debris model must consist of lists of individual debris or debris classes for each cause of breakup and any planned jettison of debris, launch vehicle components, or payload. A debris analysis must account for:

\(1\) Launch vehicle breakup caused by the activation of any flight termination system. The analysis must account for:

\(i\) The effects of debris produced when flight termination system activation destroys an intact malfunctioning vehicle.

\(ii\) Spontaneous breakup of the launch vehicle, if the breakup is assisted by the action of any inadvertent separation destruct system.

\(iii\) The effects of debris produced by the activation of any flight termination system after inadvertent breakup of the launch vehicle.

\(2\) Debris due to any malfunction where forces on the launch vehicle may exceed the launch vehicle's structural integrity limits.

\(5\) The effects of impact of the intact vehicle as a function of failure time. The intact impact debris analysis must identify the trinitrotoluene (TNT) yield of impact explosions, and the numbers of fragments projected from all such explosions, including non-launch vehicle ejecta and the blast overpressure radius. The analysis must use a model for TNT yield of impact explosion that accounts for the propellant weight at impact, the impact speed, the orientation of the propellant, and the impacted surface material.

\(c\) *Debris model.* A debris analysis must produce a model of the debris resulting from planned jettison and from unplanned breakup of a launch vehicle for use as input to other analyses, such as establishing flight safety limits and hazard areas and performing debris risk, toxic, and blast analyses. A launch operator's debris model must satisfy the following:

\(1\) *Debris fragments.* A debris model must provide the debris fragment data required by this section for the launch vehicle flight from the planned ignition time until the launch vehicle achieves orbital velocity for an orbital launch. For a sub-orbital launch, the debris model must provide the debris fragment data required by this section for the launch vehicle flight from the planned ignition time until impact of the last thrusting stage.

\(2\) *Inert fragments.* A debris model must identify all inert fragments that are not volatile and that do not burn or explode under normal and malfunction conditions. A debris model must identify all inert fragments for each breakup time during flight corresponding to a critical event when the fragment catalog is significantly changed by the event. Critical events include staging, payload fairing jettison, and other normal hardware jettison activities.

\(3\) *Explosive and non-explosive propellant fragments.* A debris model must identify all propellant fragments that are explosive or non-explosive upon impact. The debris model must describe each propellant fragment as a function of time, from the time of breakup through ballistic free-fall to impact.

For any fragment identified as an un-contained or contained propellant fragment, whether explosive or non-explosive, the debris model must identify whether or not it burns during free fall, and provide the consumption rate during free fall. The debris model must identify:

\(i\) Solid propellant that is exposed directly to the atmosphere and that burns but does not explode upon impact as “un-contained non-explosive solid propellant.”

\(ii\) Solid or liquid propellant that is enclosed in a container, such as a motor case or pressure vessel, and that burns but does not explode upon impact as “contained non-explosive propellant.”

\(iii\) Solid or liquid propellant that is enclosed in a container, such as a motor case or pressure vessel, and that explodes upon impact as “contained explosive propellant fragment.”

\(iv\) Solid propellant that is exposed directly to the atmosphere and that explodes upon impact as “un-contained explosive solid propellant fragment.”

\(4\) *Other non-inert debris fragments.* In addition to the explosive and flammable fragments required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a debris model must identify any other non-inert debris fragments, such as toxic or radioactive fragments, that present any other hazards to the public.

\(5\) *Fragment weight.* At each modeled breakup time, the individual fragment weights must approximately add up to the sum total weight of inert material in the vehicle and the weight of contained liquid propellants and solid propellants that are not consumed in the initial breakup or conflagration.

\(i\) Use a Maxwellian distribution with the specified maximum value equal to the 97th percentile; or

\(ii\) Identify the distribution, and must state whether or not the specified maximum value is a fixed value with no uncertainty.

\(7\) *Fragment projected area.* A debris model must include each of the axial, transverse, and mean tumbling areas of each fragment. If the fragment may stabilize under normal or malfunction conditions, the debris model must also provide the projected area normal to the drag force.

\(10\) *Fragment classes.* A debris model must categorize each malfunction debris fragment into classes where the characteristics of the mean fragment in each class conservatively represent every fragment in the class. The model must define fragment classes for fragments whose characteristics are similar enough to be described and treated by a single average set of characteristics. A debris class must categorize debris by each of the following characteristics, and may include any other useful characteristics:

\(i\) The type of fragment, defined by paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section. All fragments within a class must be the same type, such as inert or explosive.

\(ii\) Debris subsonic ballistic coefficient (βsub). The difference between the smallest log10(βsub) value and the largest log10(βsub) value in a class must not exceed 0.5, except for fragments with βsub less than or equal to three. Fragments with βsub less than or equal to three may be grouped within a class.

\(iii\) Breakup-imparted velocity (ΔV). A debris model must categorize fragments as a function of the range of ΔV for the fragments within a class and the class's median subsonic ballistic coefficient. For each class, the debris model must keep the ratio of the maximum breakup-imparted velocity (ΔVmax) to minimum breakup-imparted velocity (ΔVmin) within the following bound:

A launch operator must provide graphs of the coefficient of drag (Cd) as a function of Mach number for the nominal and three-sigma β variations for each fragment shape. The launch operator must label each graph with the shape represented by the curve and reference area used to develop the curve. A launch operator must provide a Cd vs. Mach curve for any axial, transverse, and tumble orientations for any fragment that will not stabilize during free-fall conditions. For any fragment that may stabilize during free-fall, a launch operator must provide Cd vs. Mach curves for the stability angle of attack. If the angle of attack where the fragment stabilizes is other than zero degrees, a launch operator must provide both the coefficient of lift (CL) vs. Mach number and the Cd vs. Mach number curves. The launch operator must provide the equations for each Cd vs. Mach curve.

\(6\) *Pre-flight propellant weight.* The initial preflight weight of solid and liquid propellant for each launch vehicle component that contains solid or liquid propellant.

\(3\) For an orbital launch where a gate permits overflight of a protected area and where orbital insertion occurs after reaching the gate, the analysis must determine the planned safe flight state as the time after liftoff when the time for the launch vehicle's instantaneous impact point to reach the gate is less than the time for the instantaneous impact point to reach any flight safety limit.

\(4\) The analysis must account for a malfunction that causes the launch vehicle to proceed from its position at the trajectory time being evaluated toward the closest flight safety limit and protected area.

\(5\) The analysis must account for the launch vehicle thrust vector that produces the highest instantaneous impact point range rate that the vehicle is capable of producing at the trajectory time being evaluated.

In addition, the analysis must establish a minimum near-pad blast hazard area to provide protection from hazardous fragments potentially propelled by an explosion. The analysis must account for the maximum possible total solid and liquid propellant explosive potential of the launch vehicle and any payload. The analysis must define a blast overpressure hazard area using the following equations:

Rop = 45 · (NEW)1/3

NEW = WE · C (pounds).

WE is the weight of the explosive in pounds.

C is the TNT equivalency coefficient of the propellant being evaluated. A launch operator must identify the TNT equivalency of each propellant on its launch vehicle including any payload. TNT equivalency data for common liquid propellants is provided in tables A417-1. Table A417-2 provides factors for converting gallons of specified liquid propellants to pounds.

For each such hazard, the analysis must determine a hazard area that encompasses any debris impact point and its dispersion and includes an additional hazard radius that accounts for potential casualty due to the additional hazard. Analysis requirements for toxic release and far field blast overpressure are provided in §417.27 and section A417.29, respectively.

\(ii\) The dispersion for each debris class must account for the position and velocity state vector dispersions at breakup, the variance produced by breakup imparted velocities, the effect of winds on both the ascent trajectory state vector at breakup and the descending debris piece impact location the variance produced by aerodynamic properties for each debris class, and any other dispersion variances.

\(iii\) A debris risk analysis must account for the survivability of debris fragments that are subject to reentry aerodynamic forces or heating. A debris class may be eliminated from the debris risk analysis if the launch operator demonstrates that the debris will not survive to impact.

\(5\) A debris risk analysis must account for launch vehicle failure probability. The following constraints apply:

\(i\) For flight safety analysis purposes, a failure occurs when a vehicle does not complete any phase of normal flight or exhibits the potential for the stage or its debris to impact the Earth or reenter the atmosphere during the mission or any future mission of similar vehicle capability. Also, either a launch incident or launch accident constitutes a failure.

\(ii\) For a launch vehicle with fewer than 2 flights completed, the analysis must use a reference value for the launch vehicle failure probability estimate equal to the upper limit of the 60% two-sided confidence limits of the binomial distribution for outcomes of all previous launches of vehicles developed and launched in similar circumstances. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate to account for the level of experience demonstrated by the launch operator and other factors that affects the probability of failure. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate for the second launch based on evidence obtained from the first flight of the vehicle.

\(iii\) For a launch vehicle with at least 2 flights completed, the analysis must use the reference value for the launch vehicle failure probability of Table A417-3 based on the outcomes of all previous launches of the vehicle. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate to account for evidence obtained from the flight history of the vehicle. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate to account for the nature of launch outcomes in the flight history of the vehicle, corrective actions taken in response to a failure of the vehicle, or other vehicle modifications that may affect reliability. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate to account for the demonstrated quality of the engineering approach to launch vehicle processing, meeting safety requirements in this part, and associated hazard mitigation. The analysis must use a final failure estimate within the confidence limits of Table A417-3.

\(A\) Values listed on the far left of Table A417-3 apply when no launch failures are experienced. Values on the far right apply when only launch failures are experienced. Values in between apply for flight histories that include both failures and successes.

\(B\) Reference values in Table A417-3 are shown in bold. The reference values are the median values between 60% two-sided confidence limits of the binomial distribution. For the special cases of zero or N failures in N launch attempts, the reference values may also be recognized as the median value between the 80% one-sided confidence limit of the binomial distribution and zero or one, respectively.

\(C\) Upper and lower confidence bounds in Table A417-3 are shown directly above and below each reference value. These confidence bounds are based on 60% two-sided confidence limits of the binomial distribution. For the special cases of zero or N failures in N launch attempts, the upper and lower confidence bounds are based on the 80% one-sided confidence limit, respectively.

\(6\) A debris risk analysis must account for the dwell time of the instantaneous impact point ground trace over each populated or protected area being evaluated.

\(7\) A debris risk analysis must account for the three-sigma instantaneous impact point trajectory variations in left-crossrange, right-crossrange, uprange, and downrange as a function of trajectory time, due to launch vehicle performance variations as determined by the trajectory analysis performed as required by section A417.7.

\(8\) A debris risk analysis must account for the effective casualty area as a function of launch vehicle flight time for all impacting debris generated from a catastrophic launch vehicle malfunction event or a planned impact event. The effective casualty area must account for both payload and vehicle systems and subsystems debris. The effective casualty area must account for all debris fragments determined as part of a launch operator's debris analysis as required by section A417.11. The effective casualty area for each explosive debris fragment must account for a 1.0 psi blast overpressure radius and the projected debris effects for all potentially explosive debris. The effective casualty area for each inert debris fragment must:

\(i\) Account for bounce, skip, slide, and splatter effects; or

\(ii\) Equal seven times the maximum projected area of the fragment.

\(9\) A debris risk analysis must account for current population density data obtained from a current population database for the region being evaluated or by estimating the current population using exponential population growth rate equations applied to the most current historical data available. The population model must define population centers that are similar enough to be described and treated as a single average set of characteristics without degrading the accuracy of the debris risk estimate.

\(10\) For a launch vehicle that uses a flight safety system, a debris risk analysis must account for the collective risk to any populations outside the flight safety limits during flight, including people who will be at any public launch viewing area during flight. For such populations, in addition to the constraints of paragraphs (b)(1) through (b)(9) of this section, a launch operator's debris risk analysis must account for the following:

\(i\) The probability of a launch vehicle failure that would result in debris impact in protected areas outside the flight safety limits.

\(ii\) The failure probability of the launch operator's flight safety system. A flight safety system failure rate of 0.002 may be used if the flight safety system complies with the flight safety system requirements of subpart D of this part. For an alternate flight safety system approved as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](a)(3), the launch operator must demonstrate the validity of the probability of failure through the licensing process.

\(iii\) Current population density data and population projections for the day and time of flight for the areas outside the flight safety limits.

\(c\) *Debris risk analysis products.* The products of a debris risk analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA include:

\(3\) A discussion of each launch vehicle failure scenario accounted for in the analysis and the probability of occurrence, which may vary with flight time, for each failure scenario. This information must include failure scenarios where a launch vehicle:

\(i\) Flies within normal limits until some malfunction causes spontaneous breakup or results in a commanded flight termination;

\(ii\) Experiences malfunction turns; and

\(iii\) Flight safety system fails to function.

\(4\) A population model applicable to the launch overflight regions that contains the following: region identification, location of the center of each population center by geodetic latitude and longitude, total area, number of persons in each population center, and a description of the shelter characteristics within the population center.

\(5\) A description of the launch vehicle, including general information concerning the nature and purpose of the launch and an overview of the launch vehicle, including a scaled diagram of the general arrangement and dimensions of the vehicle.

A flight safety analysis must include a toxic release hazard analysis that satisfies the requirements of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.227   Toxic release hazard analysis.|§417.227]]. A launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis must satisfy the methodology requirements of appendix I of this part. A launch operator must file the analysis products identified in appendix I of this part as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§417.203]](e).

# A417.29   Far field blast overpressure effects analysis

\(a\) *General.* A flight safety analysis must include a far field blast overpressure effects hazard analysis that satisfies the requirements of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.229   Far-field overpressure blast effects analysis.|§417.229]]. This section applies to the computation of far field blast overpressure effects from the proposed flight of a launch vehicle as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.229   Far-field overpressure blast effects analysis.|§417.229]] and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§417.203]](e). The analysis must account for distant focus overpressure and any overpressure enhancement to establish the potential for broken windows due to peak incident overpressures below 1.0 psi and related casualties due to falling or projected glass shards. The analysis must employ either paragraph (b) of this section or the risk analysis of paragraph (c) of this section.

\(b\) *Far field blast overpressure hazard analysis.* Unless an analysis satisfies the requirements of paragraph (c) of this section a far field blast overpressure hazard analysis must satisfy the following:

\(1\) Explosive yield factors. The analysis must use explosive yield factor curves for each type or class of solid or liquid propellant used by the launch vehicle. Each explosive yield factor curve must be based on the most accurate explosive yield data for the corresponding type or class of solid or liquid propellant based on empirical data or computational modeling.

\(2\) Establish the maximum credible explosive yield. The analysis must establish the maximum credible explosive yield resulting from normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight. The explosive yield must account for impact mass and velocity of impact on the Earth's surface. The analysis must account for explosive yield expressed as a TNT equivalent for peak overpressure.

\(3\) Characterize the population exposed to the hazard. The analysis must demonstrate whether any population centers are vulnerable to a distant focus overpressure hazard using the methodology provided by section 6.3.2.4 of the American National Standard Institute's ANSI S2.20-1983, “Estimating Air Blast Characteristics for Single Point Explosions in Air with a Guide to Evaluation of Atmospheric Propagation and Effects” and as follows:

\(i\) For the purposes of this analysis, a population center must include any area outside the launch site and not under the launch operator's control that contains an exposed site. An exposed site includes any structure that may be occupied by human beings, and that has at least one window, but does not include automobiles, airplanes, and waterborne vessels. The analysis must account for the most recent census information on each population center. The analysis must treat any exposed site for which no census information is available, or the census information indicates a population equal to or less than four persons, as a ‘single residence.’

\(ii\) The analysis must identify the distance between the location of the maximum credible impact explosion and the location of each population center potentially exposed. Unless the location of the potential explosion site is limited to a defined region, the analysis must account for the distance between the potential explosion site and a population center as the minimum distance between any point within the region contained by the flight safety limits and the nearest exposed site within the population center.

\(iii\) The analysis must account for all weather conditions optimized for a distant focus overpressure hazard by applying an atmospheric blast “focus factor” (F) of 5.

\(iv\) The analysis must determine, using the methodology of section 6.3.2.4 of ANSI S2.20-1983, for each a population center, whether the maximum credible explosive yield of a launch meets, exceeds or is less than the “no damage yield limit,” of the population center. If the maximum credible explosive yield is less than the “no damage yield limit” for all exposed sites, the remaining requirements of this section do not apply. If the maximum credible explosive yield meets or exceeds the “no damage yield limit” for a population center then that population center is vulnerable to far field blast overpressure from the launch and the requirements of paragraphs (b)(4) and (b)(5) of this section apply.

\(4\) Estimate the quantity of broken windows. The analysis must use a focus factor of 5 and the methods provided by ANSI S2.20-1983 to estimate the number of potential broken windows within each population center determined to be vulnerable to the distant focus overpressure hazard as required by paragraph (b)(3) of this section.

\(5\) Determine and implement measures necessary to prevent distant focus overpressure from breaking windows. For each population center that is vulnerable to far field blast overpressure from a launch, the analysis must identify mitigation measures to protect the public from serious injury from broken windows and the flight commit criteria of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.113   Launch safety rules.|§417.113]](c) needed to enforce the mitigation measures. A launch operator's mitigation measures must include one or more of the following:

\(i\) Apply a minimum 4-millimeter thick anti-shatter film to all exposed sites where the maximum credible yield exceeds the “no damage yield limit.”

\(ii\) Evacuate the exposed public to a location that is not vulnerable to the distant focus overpressure hazard at least two hours prior to the planned flight time.

\(iii\) If, as required by paragraph (b)(4) of this section, the analysis predicts that less than 20 windows will break, advise the public of the potential for glass breakage.

\(c\) *Far field blast overpressure risk analysis.* If a launch operator does not employ paragraph (b) of this section to perform a far field overpressure hazard analysis, the launch operator must conduct a risk analysis that demonstrates that the launch will be conducted in accordance with the public risk criteria of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](b).

\(d\) *Far field blast overpressure effect products.* The products of a far field blast overpressure analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA include:

\(1\) A description of the methodology used to produce the far field blast overpressure analysis results, a tabular description of the analysis input data, and a description of any far field blast overpressure mitigation measures implemented.

\(2\) For any far field blast overpressure risk analysis, an example set of the analysis computations.

\(3\) The values for the maximum credible explosive yield as a function of time of flight.

\(4\) The distance between the potential explosion location and any population center vulnerable to the far field blast overpressure hazard. For each population center, the launch operator must identify the exposed populations by location and number of people.

\(5\) Any mitigation measures established to protect the public from far field blast overpressure hazards and any flight commit criteria established to ensure the mitigation measures are enforced.

This section applies to a launch operator obtaining a collision avoidance assessment from United States Strategic Command as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.231   Collision avoidance analysis.|§417.231]] and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§417.203]](e). United States Strategic Command refers to a collision avoidance analysis for a space launch as a conjunction on launch assessment.

\(b\) *Analysis constraints.* A launch operator must satisfy the following when obtaining and implementing the results of a collision avoidance analysis:

\(1\) A launch operator must provide United States Strategic Command with the launch window and trajectory data needed to perform a collision avoidance analysis for a launch as required by paragraph (c) of this section, at least 15 days before the first attempt at flight. The FAA will identify a launch operator to United States Strategic Command as part of issuing a license and provide a launch operator with current United States Strategic Command contact information.

\(2\) A launch operator must obtain a collision avoidance analysis performed by United States Strategic Command 6 hours before the beginning of a launch window.

\(3\) A launch operator may use a collision avoidance analysis for 12 hours from the time that United States Strategic Command determines the state vectors of the manned or mannable orbiting objects. If a launch operator needs an updated collision avoidance analysis due to a launch delay, the launch operator must file the request with United States Strategic Command at least 12 hours prior to the beginning of the new launch window.

\(4\) For every 90 minutes, or portion of 90 minutes, that pass between the time United States Strategic Command last determined the state vectors of the orbiting objects, a launch operator must expand each wait in a launch window by subtracting 15 seconds from the start of the wait in the launch window and adding 15 seconds to the end of the wait in the launch window. A launch operator must incorporate all the resulting waits in the launch window into its flight commit criteria established as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.113   Launch safety rules.|§417.113]].

\(c\) *Information required.* A launch operator must prepare a collision avoidance analysis worksheet for each launch using a standardized format that contains the input data required by this paragraph. A launch operator must file the input data with United States Strategic Command for the purposes of completing a collision avoidance analysis. A launch operator must file the input data with the FAA as part of the license application process as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0415 Launch license.md#§415.115   Flight safety.|§415.115]] of this chapter.

\(1\) *Launch information.* A launch operator must file the following launch information:

\(i\) *Mission name.* A mnemonic given to the launch vehicle/payload combination identifying the launch mission from all others.

\(ii\) *Segment number.* A segment is defined as a launch vehicle stage or payload after the thrusting portion of its flight has ended. This includes the jettison or deployment of any stage or payload. A launch operator must provide a separate worksheet for each segment. For each segment, a launch operator must determine the “vector at injection” as defined by paragraph (c)(5) of this section. The data must present each segment number as a sequence number relative to the total number of segments for a launch, such as “1 of 5.”

\(iii\) *Launch window.* The launch window opening and closing times in Greenwich Mean Time (referred to as ZULU time) and the Julian dates for each scheduled launch attempt.

\(2\) *Point of contact.* The person or office within a launch operator's organization that collects, analyzes, and distributes collision avoidance analysis results.

\(3\) *Collision avoidance analysis analysis results transmission medium.* A launch operator must identify the transmission medium, such as voice, FAX, or e-mail, for receiving results from United States Strategic Command.

\(4\) *Requestor launch operator needs.* A launch operator must indicate the types of analysis output formats required for establishing flight commit criteria for a launch:

\(i\) *Waits.* All the times within the launch window during which flight must not be initiated.

\(ii\) *Windows.* All the times within an overall launch window during which flight may be initiated.

\(5\) *Vector at injection.* A launch operator must identify the vector at injection for each segment. “Vector at injection” identifies the position and velocity of all orbital or suborbital segments after the thrust for a segment has ended.

\(i\) *Epoch.* The epoch time, in Greenwich Mean Time (GMT), of the expected launch vehicle liftoff time.

\(ii\) *Position and velocity.* The position coordinates in the EFG coordinate system measured in kilometers and the EFG components measured in kilometers per second, of each launch vehicle stage or payload after any burnout, jettison, or deployment.

\(6\) *Time of powered flight.* The elapsed time in seconds, from liftoff to arrival at the launch vehicle vector at injection. The input data must include the time of powered flight for each stage or jettisoned component measured from liftoff.

\(7\) *Time span for launch window file (LWF).* A launch operator must provide the following information regarding its launch window:

\(i\) *Launch window.* The launch window measured in minutes from the initial proposed liftoff time.

\(ii\) *Time of powered flight.* The time provided as required by paragraph (c)(6) of this section measured in minutes rounded up to the nearest integer minute.

\(iii\) *Screen duration.* The time duration, after all thrusting periods of flight have ended, that a collision avoidance analysis must screen for potential conjunctions with manned or mannable orbital objects. Screen duration is measured in minutes and must be greater than or equal to 100 minutes for an orbital launch.

\(iv\) *Extra pad.* An additional period of time for collision avoidance analysis screening to ensure the entire first orbit is screened for potential conjunctions with manned or mannable orbital objects. This time must be 10 minutes unless otherwise specified by United States Strategic Command.

\(v\) *Total.* The summation total of the time spans provided as required by paragraphs (c)(7)(i) through (c)(7)(iv) expressed in minutes.

\(8\) *Screening.* A launch operator must select spherical or ellipsoidal screening as defined in this paragraph for determining any conjunction. The default must be the spherical screening method using an avoidance radius of 200 kilometers for manned or mannable orbiting objects. If the launch operator requests screening for any unmanned or unmannable objects, the default must be the spherical screening method using a miss distance of 25 kilometers.

\(i\) *Spherical screening.* Spherical screening utilizes an impact exclusion sphere centered on each orbiting object's center-of-mass to determine any conjunction. A launch operator must specify the avoidance radius for manned or mannable objects and for any unmanned or unmannable objects if the launch operator elects to perform the analysis for unmanned or unmannable objects.

\(ii\) *Ellipsoidal screening.* Ellipsoidal screening utilizes an impact exclusion ellipsoid of revolution centered on the orbiting object's center-of-mass to determine any conjunction. A launch operator must provide input in the UVW coordinate system in kilometers. The launch operator must provide delta-U measured in the radial-track direction, delta-V measured in the in-track direction, and delta-W measured in the cross-track direction.

\(9\) *Orbiting objects to evaluate.* A launch operator must identify the orbiting objects to be included in the analysis.

\(10\) *Deliverable schedule/need dates.* A launch operator must identify the times before flight, referred to as “L-times,” for which the launch operator requests a collision avoidance analysis.

\(a\) *General.* A launch operator must perform an aircraft hazard areas analysis as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.223   Flight hazard area analysis.|§417.223]](b). A launch operator's aircraft hazard areas analysis must determine the aircraft hazard area in the vicinity of the launch site and the aircraft hazard area in the vicinity of each planned impact location as required by this section.

\(b\) *Aircraft hazard areas analysis input.* A launch operator must account for the following inputs to determine the aircraft hazard areas:

\(1\) The trajectory analysis performed as required by section A417.7 or section C417.3; and

\(2\) The debris risk analysis performed as required by section A417.25 or section C417.9.

\(c\) *Methodology for computing an aircraft hazard area in the vicinity of the launch site.* An aircraft hazard area analysis must determine an aircraft hazard area that encompasses the launch point from the surface of the Earth to an altitude of 100,000 ft MSL and wholly contains the launch vehicle's normal trajectory plus five nautical miles in every radial direction. A launch operator must calculate an aircraft hazard area in the vicinity of the launch site as follows:

\(1\) Using the trajectory analysis performed as required by section A417.7 or section C417.3, select all data locations where the vehicle's nominal altitude, or positional component on the z-axis, is less than and equal to 100,000 ft MSL.

\(2\) From the data locations representing the dispersed trajectories calculated as required by section A417.7(d) or section C417.3(f) and modified to incorporate a 5 nm buffer as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section for the data locations selected below a nominal altitude of 100,000 ft MSL as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section, select the location that is the farthest left-hand crossrange, the location that is the farthest right-hand crossrange, the location that is the farthest downrange, and the location that is the farthest uprange.

\(3\) Construct a box in the xy plane that includes two lines parallel to the azimuth, two lines perpendicular to the azimuth, and contains the four locations selected as required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

\(4\) Extend the box constructed as required by paragraph (c)(3) of this section from the surface of the Earth to an infinite altitude.

A launch operator must compute an aircraft hazard area in the vicinity of each planned impact location as follows:

\(1\) The analysis must calculate a three-sigma dispersion ellipse by determining the three-sigma impact limit around a planned impact location.

\(2\) Taking the three-sigma dispersion ellipse calculated as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, plot a co-centric ellipse in the xy plane where the major and minor axes are 10nm longer than the major and minor axes of the three-sigma dispersion ellipse.

# B417.11   Ship hazard areas analysis

\(a\) *General.* A flight hazard area analysis must establish ship hazard areas bound by the 1 × 10−5 ship impact contour in the vicinity of the launch site and the vehicle's three-sigma dispersion limit plus a 5 nm buffer in the vicinity of a planned, downrange impact location.

\(b\) *Ship hazard area analysis input.* A launch operator must account for the following inputs to determine the ship hazard areas:

\(1\) The trajectory analysis performed as required by section A417.7 or section C417.3;

\(2\) For a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, the malfunction turn analysis required by section A417.9;

\(3\) The debris analysis required by section A417.11 or section C417.7 to define the impact locations of each class of debris established by the debris analysis;

\(4\) For a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, the time delay analysis required by section A417.21; and

\(5\) The debris risk analysis performed as required by section A417.25 or section C417.9.

\(c\) *Methodology for computing ship hazard areas in the vicinity of the launch site.* The analysis must establish the ship-hit contours as follows:

\(1\) A ship-hit contour must account for the size of the largest ship that could be located in the ship hazard area. The analysis must demonstrate that the ship size used represents the largest ship that could be present in the ship hazard area or, if the ship size is unknown, the analysis must use a ship size of 120,000 square feet.

\(2\) The analysis must first calculate the probability of impacting the reference ship selected as required by paragraph (c)(1) of this section at the location of interest. From the location of interest, move the ship away from the launch location along a single radial until the probability that debris is present at that location multiplied by the probability that a ship is at that location is less than or equal to 1 × 10−5. When calculating the probability of impacting a ship, an impact occurs when:

\(i\) The analysis predicts that inert debris will directly impact the vessel with a mean expected kinetic energy at impact greater than or equal to 11 ft-lbs; or

\(ii\) The analysis predicts the peak incident overpressure at the reference vessel will be greater than or equal to 1.0 psi due to any explosive debris impact.

\(3\) The analysis must account for:

\(i\) The variance in winds;

\(ii\) The aerodynamic properties of the debris;

\(iii\) The variance in velocity of the debris;

\(iv\) Guidance and performance errors;

\(v\) The type of vehicle breakup, either by any flight termination system or by aerodynamic forces that may result in different debris characteristics; and

\(vi\) Debris impact dispersion resulting from vehicle breakup and the malfunction turn capabilities of the launch vehicle.

\(4\) Repeat the process outlined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section while varying the radial direction until enough locations are found where the reference ship's probability of impact is less than or equal to 1 × 10−5 such that connecting each location will result in a smooth and continuous contour.

\(d\) *Methodology for computing ship hazard areas in the vicinity of each planned water impact location.* A launch operator must compute a ship hazard area in the vicinity of each planned impact location as required by the following:

\(1\) The analysis must calculate a three-sigma dispersion ellipse by determining the three-sigma impact limit around a planned impact location.

\(2\) Taking the three-sigma dispersion ellipse calculated as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section, plot a co-centric ellipse in the xy plane where the major and minor axes are 10 nm longer than the major and minor axes of the three-sigma dispersion ellipse.

# B417.13   Land hazard areas analysis

\(a\) *General.* A flight hazard area analysis must establish land hazard areas in the vicinity of the launch site and land hazard areas in the vicinity of each land impact location to ensure that the probability of a member of the public being struck by debris satisfies the probability threshold of 1 × 10−6 required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](b) and to determine exclusion areas that may require entry control and surveillance prior to initiation of flight. The analysis must establish a land impact hazard area that accounts for the effects of impacting debris resulting from normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight, except for toxic effects, and accounts for potential impact locations of all debris fragments. The land hazard area must encompass all individual casualty contours and the near-launch-point blast hazard area calculated as required by paragraph (c) of this section. A launch operator may initiate flight only if no member of the public is present within the land hazard area.

\(b\) *Land hazard areas analysis input.* A land hazard analysis must account for the following inputs to determine the land hazard area:

\(1\) The trajectory analysis performed as required by section A417.7 or section C417.3;

\(2\) For a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, the malfunction turn analysis required by section A417.9;

\(3\) The debris analysis required by section A417.11 or section C417.7 to define the impact locations of each class of debris established by the debris analysis;

\(4\) For a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, the time delay analysis required by section A417.21; and

\(5\) The debris risk analysis performed as required by section A417.25 or section C417.9.

\(c\) *Methodology for computing land hazard areas in the vicinity of the launch site and in the vicinity of each planned land impact location.* The analysis must establish a land hazard area as follows:

\(1\) Each land hazard area must completely encompass all individual casualty contours that define where the risk to an individual would exceed the expected casualty (Ec) criteria of 1 × 10−6 if one person were assumed to be in the open and inside the contour during launch vehicle flight. The analysis must produce an individual casualty contour as follows:

\(i\) The analysis must account for the location of a hypothetical person, and must vary the location of the person to determine when the risk would exceed the Ec criteria of 1 × 10−6. The analysis must count a person as a casualty when the person's location is subjected to any inert debris impact with a mean expected kinetic energy greater than or equal to 11 ft-lbs or a peak incident overpressure equal to or greater than 1.0 psi due to explosive debris impact. The analysis must determine the peak incident overpressure using the Kingery-Bulmash relationship, without regard to sheltering, reflections, or atmospheric effects.

\(ii\) The analysis must account for all person locations that are no more than 1000 feet apart in the downrange direction and no more than 1000 feet apart in the crossrange direction to produce an individual casualty contour. For each person location, the analysis must sum all the probabilities of casualty over all flight times for all debris groups.

\(iii\) An individual casualty contour must consist of curves that are smooth and continuous. To accomplish this, the analysis must vary the time interval between each trajectory time assessed so that each location of a debris impact point is less than one-half sigma of the downrange dispersion distance.

\(2\) The input for determining a land impact hazard area must account for the following in order to define the impact locations of each class of debris established by the debris analysis and the time delay analysis required by section A417.21 for a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system:

\(i\) The results of the trajectory analysis required by section A417.7 or section C417.3;

\(ii\) The malfunction turn analysis required by section A417.9 for a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system; and

\(iii\) The debris analysis required by section A417.11 or section C417.7.

\(3\) The analysis must account for the extent of the impact debris dispersions for each debris class produced by normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight at each trajectory time. The analysis must also account for how the vehicle breaks up, either by any flight termination system or by aerodynamic forces, if the different breakup may result in a different probability of existence for each debris class. A land impact hazard area must account for each impacting debris fragment classified as required by section A417.11(c) or section C417.7.

\(4\) For a launch vehicle flown with a flight safety system, the analysis must account for launch vehicle flight that exceeds a flight safety limit. The analysis must also account for trajectory conditions that maximize the mean debris impact distance during the flight safety system delay time determined as required by section A417.21 and account for a debris model that is representative of a flight termination or aerodynamic breakup.

\(5\) For each launch vehicle breakup event, the analysis must account for trajectory and breakup dispersions, variations in debris class characteristics, and debris dispersion due to any wind condition under which a launch would be attempted.

\(6\) The analysis must account for the probability of failure of each launch vehicle stage and the probability of existence of each debris class. The analysis must account for the probability of occurrence of each type of launch vehicle failure. The analysis must account for each vehicle failure probabilities that vary depending on the time of flight.

\(7\) In addition to failure debris, the analysis must account for nominal jettisoned body debris impacts and the corresponding debris impact dispersions. The analysis must use a probability of occurrence of 1.0 for the planned debris fragments produced by normal separation events during flight.

\(d\) *Near-launch-point blast hazard area.* A land hazard area analysis must define a blast overpressure hazard area as a circle extending from the launch point with a radius equal to the 1.0 psi overpressure distance produced by the equivalent TNT weight of the explosive capability of the vehicle. In addition, the analysis must establish a minimum near-launch point blast hazard area to provide protection from hazardous fragments potentially propelled by an explosion. The analysis must account for the maximum possible total solid and liquid propellant explosive potential of the launch vehicle and any payload. The analysis must define a blast overpressure hazard area using the following equations:

Rop = 45 · (NEW)1/3

Rop is the over pressure distance in feet.

NEW = WE · C (pounds).

WE is the weight of the explosive in pounds.

C is the TNT equivalency coefficient of the propellant being evaluated. A launch operator must identify the TNT equivalency of each propellant on its launch vehicle including any payload. TNT equivalency data for common liquid propellants is provided in tables A417-1. Table A417-2 provides factors for converting gallons of specified liquid propellants to pounds.

\(e\) *Other hazards.* A flight hazard area analysis must identify any additional hazards, such as radioactive material, that may exist on the launch vehicle or payload. For each such hazard, the analysis must determine a hazard area that encompasses any debris impact point and its dispersion and includes an additional hazard radius that accounts for potential casualty due to the additional hazard. Analysis requirements for toxic release and far field blast overpressure are provided in sections A417.27 and A417.29, respectively.

\(f\) *Land impact dispersion ellipses.* A land impact hazard area must contain the land impact dispersion ellipse for each planned land impact. A launch operator must compute a land impact dispersion ellipse in the vicinity of each planned land impact location as follows:

\(1\) The analysis must calculate a one-sigma dispersion ellipse by determining the one-sigma impact limit around a planned impact location.

\(2\) Taking the one-sigma dispersion ellipse calculated as required by paragraph (f)(1) of this section, plot a co-centric ellipse in the xy plane where the major and minor axes are 10nm longer than the major and minor axes of the one-sigma dispersion ellipse.

A drag impact point reflects the effects of atmospheric influences as a function of drag forces and mach number.

\(2\) *Maximum range trajectory* means an optimized trajectory, extended through fuel exhaustion of each stage, to achieve a maximum downrange drag impact point.

\(5\) *Performance error parameter* means a quantifiable perturbing force that contributes to the dispersion of a drag impact point in the uprange, downrange, and cross-range directions of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle stage or other impacting launch vehicle component. Performance error parameters for the launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle reflect rocket performance variations and any external forces that can cause offsets from the nominal trajectory during normal flight. Performance error parameters include thrust, thrust misalignment, specific impulse, weight, variation in firing times of the stages, fuel flow rates, contributions from the wind weighting safety system employed, and winds.

\(c\) *Input.* A trajectory analysis requires the input necessary to produce a six-degree-of-freedom trajectory. A launch operator must use each of the following as inputs to the trajectory computations:

\(1\) Launcher data, as follows—

\(i\) Geodetic latitude and longitude;

\(ii\) Height above sea level;

\(iii\) All location errors; and

\(iv\) Launch azimuth and elevation.

\(2\) Reference ellipsoidal Earth model, as follows—

\(3\) *Vehicle characteristics for each stage.* A launch operator must identify the following for each stage of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle's flight:

\(i\) Nozzle exit area of each stage.

\(ii\) Distance from the rocket nose-tip to the nozzle exit for each stage.

\(iii\) Reference drag area and reference diameter of the rocket including any payload for each stage of flight.

\(5\) *Atmosphere.* Density as a function of altitude, pressure as a function of altitude, speed of sound as a function of altitude, temperature as a function of altitude.

\(6\) *Wind errors.* Error in measurement of wind direction as a function of altitude and wind magnitude as a function of altitude, wind forecast error, such as error due to time delay from wind measurement to launch.

\(d\) *Methodology for determining the nominal trajectory and nominal drag impact points.* A launch operator must employ the steps in paragraphs (d)(1)-(d)(3) of this section to determine the nominal trajectory and the nominal drag impact point locations for each impacting rocket stage and component:

\(1\) A launch operator must identify each performance error parameter associated with the unguided suborbital launch vehicle's design and operation and the value for each parameter that reflect nominal rocket performance. A launch operator must identify each performance error parameter's distribution to account for all launch vehicle performance variations and any external forces that can cause offsets from the nominal trajectory during normal flight. These performance error parameters include thrust misalignment, thrust variation, weight variation, fin misalignment, impulse variation, aerodynamic drag variation, staging timing variation, stage separation-force variation, drag error, uncompensated wind, launcher elevation angle error, launcher azimuth angle error, launcher tip-off, and launcher location error.

\(2\) A launch operator must perform a no-wind trajectory simulation using a six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) trajectory simulation with all performance error parameters set to their nominal values to determine the impact point of each stage or component. The 6-DOF trajectory simulation must provide rocket position translation along three axes of an orthogonal Earth-centered coordinate system and rocket orientation in roll, pitch and yaw. The 6-DOF trajectory simulation must compute each translation and orientation in response to forces and moments internal and external to the rocket including all the effects of the input data required by paragraph (c) of this section. A launch operator may incorporate the following assumptions in a 6-DOF trajectory simulation:

\(i\) The airframe may be treated as a rigid body.

\(ii\) The airframe may have a plane of symmetry coinciding with the vertical plane of reference.

\(iii\) The vehicle may have aerodynamic symmetry in roll.

\(iv\) The airframe may have six degrees-of-freedom.

\(v\) The aerodynamic forces and moments may be functions of mach number and may be linear with small flow incidence angles of attack.

\(3\) A launch operator must tabulate the geodetic latitude and longitude of the launch vehicle's nominal drag impact point as a function of trajectory time and the final nominal drag impact point of each planned impacting stage or component.

\(e\) *Methodology for determining maximum downrange drag impact points.* A launch operator must compute the maximum possible downrange drag impact point for each launch vehicle stage and impacting component. A launch operator must use the nominal drag impact point methodology, as defined by paragraph (d) of this section, modified to optimize the unguided suborbital launch vehicle's performance and flight profile to create the conditions for a maximum downrange drag impact point, including fuel exhaustion for each stage and impacting component.

\(f\) *Methodology for computing drag impact point dispersions.* A launch operator must employ the steps in paragraphs (f)(1)-(f)(3) of this section when determining the dispersions in terms of drag impact point distance standard deviations in uprange, downrange, and crossrange direction from the nominal drag impact point location for each stage and impacting component:

\(1\) For each stage of flight, a launch operator must identify the plus and minus one-sigma values for each performance error parameter identified as required by paragraph (d)(1) of this section (*i.e.*, nominal value plus one standard deviation and nominal value minus one standard deviation). A launch operator must determine the dispersion in downrange, uprange, and left and right crossrange for each impacting stage and component. A launch operator may either perform a Monte Carlo analysis that accounts for the distribution of each performance error parameter or determine the dispersion by a root-sum-square method under paragraph (f)(2) of this section.

\(2\) When using a root-sum-square method to determine dispersion, a launch operator must determine the deviations for a given stage by evaluating the deviations produced in that stage due to the performance errors in that stage and all preceding stages of the launch vehicle as illustrated in Table C417-1, and by computing the square root of the sum of the squares of each deviation caused by each performance error parameter's one sigma dispersion for each stage in each of the right crossrange, left crossrange, uprange and downrange directions. A launch operator must evaluate the performance errors for one stage at a time, with the performance of all subsequent stages assumed to be nominal. A launch operator's root-sum-square method must incorporate the following requirements:

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er25au06.012.pdf)

\(i\) With the 6-DOF trajectory simulation used to determine nominal drag impact points as required by paragraph (d) of this section, perform a series of trajectory simulation runs for each stage and planned ejected debris, such as a fairing, payload, or other component, and, for each simulation, model only one performance error parameter set to either its plus or minus one-sigma value. For a given simulation run, set all other performance error parameters to their nominal values. Continue until achieving a trajectory simulation run for each plus one-sigma performance error parameter value and each minus one-sigma performance error parameter value for the stage or the planned ejected debris being evaluated. For each trajectory simulation run and for each impact being evaluated, tabulate the downrange, uprange, left crossrange, and right crossrange drag impact point distance deviations measured from the nominal drag impact point location for that stage or planned debris.

\(ii\) For uprange, downrange, right crossrange, and left crossrange, compute the square root of the sum of the squares of the distance deviations in each direction. The square root of the sum of the squares distance value for each direction represents the one-sigma drag impact point dispersion in that direction. For a multiple stage rocket, perform the first stage series of simulation runs with all subsequent stage performance error parameters set to their nominal value. Tabulate the uprange, downrange, right crossrange, and left crossrange distance deviations from the nominal impact for each subsequent drag impact point location caused by the first stage one-sigma performance error parameter. Use these deviations in determining the total drag impact point dispersions for the subsequent stage impacts as described in paragraph (f)(2)(iii) of this section.

\(iii\) For each subsequent stage impact of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle, determine the one-sigma impact dispersions by first determining the one-sigma distance deviations for that stage impact caused by each preceding stage as described in paragraph (f)(2)(ii) of this section. Then perform a series of simulation runs and tabulate the uprange, downrange, right crossrange, and left crossrange drag impact point distance deviations as described in paragraph (f)(2)(i) of this section for that stage's one-sigma performance error parameter values with the preceding stage performance parameters set to nominal values. For each uprange, downrange, right crossrange, and left crossrange direction, compute the square root of the sum of the squares of the stage impact distance deviations due to that stage's and each preceding stage's one-sigma performance error parameter values. This square root of the sum of the squares distance value for each direction represents the total one-sigma drag impact point dispersion in that direction for the nominal drag impact point location of that stage. Use these deviations when determining the total drag impact point dispersions for the subsequent stage impacts.

\(3\) A launch operator must determine a three-sigma dispersion area for each impacting stage or component as an ellipse that is centered at the nominal drag impact point location and has semi-major and semi-minor axes along the uprange, downrange, left crossrange, and right crossrange axes. The length of each axis must be three times as large as the total one-sigma drag impact point dispersions in each direction.

\(g\) *Trajectory analysis products for a suborbital launch vehicle.* A launch operator must file the following products of a trajectory analysis for an unguided suborbital launch vehicle with the FAA as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§417.203]](e):

\(2\) A description of all assumptions and procedures the launch operator used in deriving each of the performance error parameters and their standard deviations.

\(3\) Launch point origin data: name, geodetic latitude (+N), longitude (+E), geodetic height, and launch azimuth measured clockwise from true north.

\(4\) Name of reference ellipsoid Earth model used. If a launch operator employs a reference ellipsoid Earth model other than WGS-84, Department of Defense World Geodetic System, Military Standard 2401 (Jan. 11, 1994), the launch operator must identify the semi-major axis, semi-minor axis, eccentricity, flattening parameter, gravitational parameter, rotation angular velocity, gravitational harmonic constants (e.g., J2, J3, J4), and mass of Earth.

\(5\) If a launch operator converts latitude and longitude coordinates between different ellipsoidal Earth models to complete a trajectory analysis, the launch operator must file the equations for geodetic datum conversions and a sample calculation for converting the geodetic latitude and longitude coordinates between the models employed.

\(6\) A launch operator must file tabular data that lists each performance error parameter used in the trajectory computations and each performance error parameter's plus and minus one-sigma values. If the launch operator employs a Monte Carlo analysis method for determining the dispersions about the nominal drag impact point, the tabular data must list the total one-sigma drag impact point distance deviations in each direction for each impacting stage and component. If the launch operator employs the square root of the sum of the squares method of paragraph (f)(2) of this section, the tabular data must include the one-sigma drag impact point distance deviations in each direction due to each one-sigma performance error parameter value for each impacting stage and component.

\(7\) A launch operator must file a graphical depiction showing geographical landmasses and the nominal and maximum range trajectories from liftoff until impact of the final stage. The graphical depiction must plot trajectory points in time intervals of no greater than one second during thrusting flight and for times corresponding to ignition, thrust termination or burnout, and separation of each stage or impacting body. If there are less than four seconds between stage separation or other jettison events, a launch operator must reduce the time intervals between plotted trajectory points to 0.2 seconds or less. The graphical depiction must show total launch vehicle velocity as a function of time, present-position ground-range as a function of time, altitude above the reference ellipsoid as a function of time, and the static stability margin as a function of time.

\(8\) A launch operator must file tabular data that describes the nominal and maximum range trajectories from liftoff until impact of the final stage. The tabular data must include the time after liftoff, altitude above the reference ellipsoid, present position ground range, and total launch vehicle velocity for ignition, burnout, separation, booster apogee, and booster impact of each stage or impacting body. The launch operator must file the tabular data for the same time intervals required by paragraph (g)(7) of this section.

\(9\) A launch operator must file a graphical depiction showing all geographical landmasses and the unguided suborbital launch vehicle's drag impact point for the nominal trajectory, the maximum impact range boundary, and the three-sigma drag impact point dispersion area for each impacting stage or component. The graphical depiction must show the following in relationship to each other: The nominal trajectory, a circle whose radius represents the range to the farthest downrange impact point that results from the maximum range trajectory, and the three-sigma drag impact point dispersions for each impacting stage and component.

\(10\) A launch operator must file tabular data that describes the nominal trajectory, the maximum impact range boundary, and each three-sigma drag impact point dispersion area. The tabular data must include the geodetic latitude (positive north of the equator) and longitude (positive east of the Greenwich Meridian) of each point describing the nominal drag impact point positions, the maximum range circle, and each three-sigma impact dispersion area boundary. Each three-sigma dispersion area must be described by no less than 20 coordinate pairs. All coordinates must be rounded to the fourth decimal point.

# C417.5   Wind weighting analysis

\(a\) *General.* As part of a wind weighting safety system, a launch operator must perform a wind weighting analysis to determine launcher azimuth and elevation settings that correct for the windcocking and wind-drift effects on an unguided suborbital launch vehicle due to forecasted winds in the airspace region of flight. A launch operator's wind weighting safety system and its operation must comply with [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.125   Launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle.|§417.125]](c). The launch azimuth and elevation settings resulting from a launch operator's wind weighting analysis must produce a trajectory, under actual wind conditions, that results in a final stage drag impact point that is the same as the final stage's nominal drag impact point determined according to section C417.3(d).

\(b\) *Wind weighting analysis constraints.* (1) A launch operator's wind weighting analysis must:

\(i\) Account for the winds in the airspace region through which the rocket will fly. A launch operator's wind weighting safety system must include an operational method of determining the wind direction and wind magnitude at all altitudes that the rocket will reach up to the maximum altitude defined by dispersion analysis as required by section C417.3.

\(ii\) Account for all errors due to the methods used to measure the winds in the airspace region of the launch, delay associated with wind measurement, and the method used to model the effects of winds. The resulting sum of these error components must be no greater than those used as the wind error dispersion parameter in the launch vehicle trajectory analysis performed as required by section C417.3.

\(iii\) Account for the dispersion of all impacting debris, including any uncorrected wind error accounted for in the trajectory analysis performed as required by section C417.3.

\(iv\) Establish flight commit criteria that are a function of the analysis and operational methods employed and reflect the maximum wind velocities and wind variability for which the results of the wind weighting analysis are valid.

\(v\) Account for the wind effects during each thrusting phase of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle's flight and each ballistic phase of each rocket stage and component until burnout of the last stage.

\(vi\) Determine the impact point location for any parachute recovery of a stage or component or the launch operator must perform a wind drift analysis to determine the parachute impact point location.

\(2\) A launch operator must perform a wind weighting analysis using a six-degrees-of-freedom (6-DOF) trajectory simulation that targets an impact point using an iterative process. The 6-DOF simulation must account for launch day wind direction and wind magnitude as a function of altitude.

\(3\) A launch operator must perform a wind weighting analysis using a computer program or other method of editing wind data, recording the time the data was obtained, and recording the balloon number or identification of any other measurement device used for each wind altitude layer.

\(c\) *Methodology for performing a wind weighting analysis.* A launch operator's method for performing a wind weighting analysis on the day of flight must account for the following:

\(1\) A launch operator must measure the winds on the day of flight to determine wind velocity and direction. A launch operator's process for measuring winds must provide wind data that is consistent with any assumptions made in the launch operator's trajectory and drag impact point dispersion analysis, as required by section C417.3, regarding the actual wind data available on the day of flight. Wind measurements must be made at altitude increments such that the maximum correction between any two measurements does not exceed 5%. Winds must be measured from the ground level at the launch point to a maximum altitude that is consistent with the launch operator's drag impact point dispersion analysis. The maximum wind measurement altitude must be that necessary to account for 99% of the wind effect on the impact dispersion point. A launch operator's wind measuring process must employ the use of balloons and radar tracking or balloons fitted with a Global Positioning System transceiver, and must account for the following:

\(i\) Measure winds from ground level to an altitude of at least that necessary to account for 99% of the wind effect on the impact dispersion point within six hours before flight and after any weather front passes the launch site before liftoff. Repeat a wind measurement up to the maximum altitude whenever a wind measurement, for any given altitude, from a later balloon release is not consistent with a wind measurement, for the same altitude, from an earlier balloon release.

\(ii\) Measure winds from ground level to an altitude of at least that necessary to account for 95% of the wind effect on the impact dispersion point within four hours before flight and after any weather front passes the launch site before liftoff. Repeat a wind measurement to the 95% wind effect altitude whenever a wind measurement, for any given altitude, from a later lower altitude balloon release is not consistent with the wind measurement, for the same altitude, from the 95% wind effect altitude balloon release.

\(iii\) Measure winds from ground level to an altitude of no less than that necessary to account for 80% of the wind effect on the impact dispersion point twice within 30 minutes of liftoff. Use the first measurement to set launcher azimuth and elevation, and the second measurement to verify the first measurement data.

\(2\) A launch operator must perform runs of the 6-DOF trajectory simulation using the flight day measured winds as input and targeting for the nominal final stage drag impact point. In an iterative process, vary the launcher elevation angle and azimuth angle settings for each simulation run until the nominal final stage impact point is achieved. The launch operator must use the resulting launcher elevation angle and azimuth angle settings to correct for the flight day winds. The launch operator must not initiate flight unless the launcher elevation angle and azimuth angle settings after wind weighting are in accordance with the following:

\(i\) The launcher elevation angle setting resulting from the wind weighting analysis must not exceed ±5° from the nominal launcher elevation angle setting and must not exceed a total of 86° for a proven launch vehicle, and 84° for an unproven launch vehicle. A launch operator's nominal launcher elevation angle setting must be as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.125   Launch of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle.|§417.125]](c)(3).

\(ii\) The launcher azimuth angle setting resulting from the wind weighting analysis must not exceed + 30° from the nominal launcher azimuth angle setting unless the launch operator demonstrates clearly and convincingly, through the licensing process, that its unguided suborbital launch vehicle has a low sensitivity to high wind speeds, and the launch operator's wind weighting analysis and wind measuring process provide an equivalent level of safety.

\(3\) Using the trajectory produced in paragraph (c)(2) of this section, for each intermediate stage and planned ejected component, a launch operator must compute the impact point that results from wind drift by performing a run of the 6-DOF trajectory simulation with the launcher angles determined in paragraph (c)(2) of this section and the flight day winds from liftoff until the burnout time or ejection time of the stage or ejected component. The resulting impact point(s) must be accounted for when performing flight day ship-hit operations defined in section B417.11(c).

\(4\) If a parachute is used for any stage or component, a launch operator must determine the wind drifted impact point of the stage or component using a trajectory simulation that incorporates modeling for the change in aerodynamics at parachute ejection. Perform this simulation run in addition to any simulation of spent stages without parachutes.

\(5\) A launch operator must verify that the launcher elevation angle and azimuth angle settings at the time of liftoff are the same as required by the wind weighting analysis.

\(6\) A launch operator must monitor and verify that any wind variations and maximum wind limits at the time of liftoff are within the flight commit criteria established according to [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.113   Launch safety rules.|§417.113]](c).

\(7\) A launch operator must generate output data from its wind weighting analysis for each impacting stage or component in printed, plotted, or computer medium format. This data must include:

\(i\) Launch day wind measurement data, including magnitude and direction.

\(ii\) The results of each computer run made using the launch day wind measurement data, including but not limited to, launcher settings, and impact locations for each stage or component.

\(iii\) Final launcher settings recorded.

\(d\) *Wind weighting analysis products.* The products of a launch operator's wind weighting analysis filed with the FAA as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§417.203]](e) must include the following:

\(1\) A launch operator must file a description of its wind weighting analysis methods, including its method and schedule of determining wind speed and wind direction for each altitude layer.

\(2\) A launch operator must file a description of its wind weighting safety system and identify all equipment used to perform the wind weighting analysis, such as any wind towers, balloons, or Global Positioning System wind measurement system employed and the type of trajectory simulation employed.

\(3\) A launch operator must file a sample wind weighting analysis using actual or statistical winds for the launch area and provide samples of the output required by paragraph (c)(7) of this section.

# C417.7   Debris analysis

\(a\) *General.* A flight safety analysis must include a debris analysis that satisfies the requirements of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.211   Debris analysis.|§417.211]]. This section applies to the debris data required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.211   Debris analysis.|§417.211]] and the debris analysis products that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§417.203]](e).

\(b\) *Debris analysis constraints.* A debris analysis must produce the debris model described in paragraph (c) of this section. The analysis must account for all launch vehicle debris fragments, individually or in groupings of fragments called classes. The characteristics of each debris fragment represented by a class must be similar enough to the characteristics of all the other debris fragments represented by that class that all the debris fragments of the class can be described by a single set of characteristics. Paragraph (c)(10) of this section applies when establishing a debris class. A debris model must describe the physical, aerodynamic, and harmful characteristics of each debris fragment either individually or as a member of a class. A debris model must consist of lists of individual debris or debris classes for each cause of breakup and any planned jettison of debris, launch vehicle components, or payload. A debris analysis must account for:

\(1\) Debris due to any malfunction where forces on the launch vehicle may exceed the launch vehicle's structural integrity limits.

\(2\) The immediate post-breakup or jettison environment of the launch vehicle debris, and any change in debris characteristics over time from launch vehicle breakup or jettison until debris impact.

\(3\) The impact overpressure, fragmentation, and secondary debris effects of any confined or unconfined solid propellant chunks and fueled components containing either liquid or solid propellants that could survive to impact, as a function of vehicle malfunction time.

\(4\) The effects of impact of the intact vehicle as a function of failure time. The intact impact debris analysis must identify the trinitrotoluene (TNT) yield of impact explosions, and the numbers of fragments projected from all such explosions, including non-launch vehicle ejecta and the blast overpressure radius. The analysis must use a model for TNT yield of impact explosion that accounts for the propellant weight at impact, the impact speed, the orientation of the propellant, and the impacted surface material.

\(c\) *Debris model.* A debris analysis must produce a model of the debris resulting from planned jettison and from unplanned breakup of a launch vehicle for use as input to other analyses, such as establishing hazard areas and performing debris risk and toxic analyses. A launch operator's debris model must satisfy the following:

\(1\) *Debris fragments.* A debris model must provide the debris fragment data required by this section for the launch vehicle flight from the planned ignition time until thrust termination of the last thrusting stage. A debris model must provide debris fragment data for the number of time periods sufficient to meet the requirements for smooth and continuous contours used to define hazard areas as required by appendix B of this part.

\(2\) *Inert fragments.* A debris model must identify all inert fragments that are not volatile and that do not burn or explode under normal and malfunction conditions. A debris model must identify all inert fragments for each breakup time during flight corresponding to a critical event when the fragment catalog is significantly changed by the event. Critical events include staging, payload fairing jettison, and other normal hardware jettison activities.

\(3\) *Explosive and non-explosive propellant fragments.* A debris model must identify all propellant fragments that are explosive or non-explosive upon impact. The debris model must describe each propellant fragment as a function of time, from the time of breakup through ballistic free-fall to impact. The debris model must describe the characteristics of each fragment, including its origin on the launch vehicle, representative dimensions and weight at the time of breakup and at the time of impact. For any fragment identified as an un-contained or contained propellant fragment, whether explosive or non-explosive, the debris model must identify whether or not it burns during free fall, and provide the consumption rate during free fall. The debris model must identify:

\(i\) Solid propellant that is exposed directly to the atmosphere and that burns but does not explode upon impact as “un-contained non-explosive solid propellant.”

\(ii\) Solid or liquid propellant that is enclosed in a container, such as a motor case or pressure vessel, and that burns but does not explode upon impact as “contained non-explosive propellant.”

\(iii\) Solid or liquid propellant that is enclosed in a container, such as a motor case or pressure vessel, and that explodes upon impact as “contained explosive propellant fragment.”

\(iv\) Solid propellant that is exposed directly to the atmosphere and that explodes upon impact as “un-contained explosive solid propellant fragment.”

\(4\) *Other non-inert debris fragments.* In addition to the explosive and flammable fragments identified under paragraph (c)(3) of this section, a debris model must identify any other non-inert debris fragments, such as toxic or radioactive fragments, that present any other hazards to the public.

\(5\) *Fragment weight.* At each modeled breakup time, the individual fragment weights must approximately add up to the sum total weight of inert material in the vehicle and the weight of contained liquid propellants and solid propellants that are not consumed in the initial breakup or conflagration.

\(6\) *Fragment imparted velocity.* A debris model must identify the maximum velocity imparted to each fragment due to potential explosion or pressure rupture. When accounting for imparted velocity, a debris model must:

\(i\) Use a Maxwellian distribution with the specified maximum value equal to the 97th percentile; or

\(ii\) Identify the distribution, and state whether or not the specified maximum value is a fixed value with no uncertainty.

\(7\) *Fragment projected area.* A debris model must include each of the axial, transverse, and mean tumbling areas of each fragment. If the fragment may stabilize under normal or malfunction conditions, the debris model must also provide the projected area normal to the drag force.

\(8\) *Fragment ballistic coefficient.* A debris model must include the axial, transverse, and tumble orientation ballistic coefficient for each fragment's projected area as required by paragraph (c)(7) of this section.

\(9\) *Debris fragment count.* A debris model must include the total number of each type of fragment required by paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section and created by a malfunction.

\(10\) *Fragment classes.* A debris model must categorize malfunction debris fragments into classes where the characteristics of the mean fragment in each class conservatively represent every fragment in the class. The model must define fragment classes for fragments whose characteristics are similar enough to be described and treated by a single average set of characteristics. A debris class must categorize debris by each of the following characteristics, and may include any other useful characteristics:

\(i\) The type of fragment, defined by paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3), and (c)(4) of this section. All fragments within a class must be the same type, such as inert or explosive.

\(ii\) Debris subsonic ballistic coefficient (βsub). The difference between the smallest log10(βsub) value and the largest log10(βsub) value in a class must not exceed 0.5, except for fragments with βsub less than or equal to three. Fragments with βsub less than or equal to three may be grouped within a class.

\(iii\) Breakup-imparted velocity (ΔV). A debris model must categorize fragments as a function of the range of ΔV for the fragments within a class and the class's median subsonic ballistic coefficient. For each class, the debris model must keep the ratio of the maximum breakup-imparted velocity (ΔVmax) to minimum breakup-imparted velocity (ΔVmin) within the following bound:

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er25au06.107.pdf)

β′sub is the median subsonic ballistic coefficient for the fragments in a class.

\(d\) *Debris analysis products.* The products of a debris analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§417.203]](e) must include:

A launch operator must provide graphs of the coefficient of drag (Cd) as a function of Mach number for the nominal and three-sigma β variations for each fragment shape. The launch operator must label each graph with the shape represented by the curve and reference area used to develop the curve. A launch operator must provide a Cd vs. Mach curve for any axial, transverse, and tumble orientations for any fragment that will not stabilize during free-fall conditions. For any fragment that may stabilize during free-fall, a launch operator must provide Cd vs. Mach curves for the stability angle of attack. If the angle of attack where the fragment stabilizes is other than zero degrees, a launch operator must provide both the coefficient of lift (CL) vs. Mach number and the Cd vs. Mach number curves. The launch operator must provide the equations for each Cd vs. Mach curve.

\(14\) *Contained propellant fragments, explosive or non-explosive.* For contained propellant fragments, whether explosive or non-explosive, a launch operator must provide the initial weight of contained propellant and the consumption rate during free-fall. The initial weight of the propellant in a contained propellant fragment is the weight of the propellant before any of the propellant is consumed by normal vehicle operation or failure of the launch vehicle.

\(15\) *Solid propellant fragment snuff-out pressure.* The ambient pressure and the pressure at the surface of a solid propellant fragment, in pounds per square inch, required to sustain a solid propellant fragment's combustion during free-fall.

\(16\) *Other non-inert debris fragments.* For each non-inert debris fragment identified as required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section, a launch operator must describe the diffusion, dispersion, deposition, radiation, and other hazard exposure characteristics used to determine the effective casualty area required by paragraph (c)(9) of this section.

\(17\) *Residual thrust dispersion.* For each thrusting or non-thrusting stage having residual thrust capability following a launch vehicle malfunction, a launch operator must provide either the total residual impulse imparted or the full-residual thrust in foot-pounds as a function of breakup time. For any stage not capable of thrust after a launch vehicle malfunction, a launch operator must provide the conditions under which the stage is no longer capable of thrust. For each stage that can be ignited as a result of a launch vehicle malfunction on a lower stage, a launch operator must identify the effects and duration of the potential thrust, and the maximum deviation of the instantaneous impact point which can be brought about by the thrust.

# C417.9   Debris risk

\(a\) *General.* A launch operator must perform a debris risk analysis that satisfies the requirements of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.225   Debris risk analysis.|§417.225]]. This section applies to the computation of the average number of casualties (Ec) to the collective members of the public exposed to inert and explosive debris hazards from the proposed flight of an unguided suborbital launch vehicle as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.225   Debris risk analysis.|§417.225]] and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§417.203]](e).

\(b\) *Debris risk analysis constraints.* The following constraints apply to debris risk:

\(1\) A debris risk analysis must use valid risk analysis models that compute Ec as the summation over all trajectory time intervals from lift-off through impact of the products of the probability of each possible event and the casualty consequences due to debris impacts for each possible event.

\(2\) A debris risk analysis must account for the following populations:

\(i\) The overflight of populations located inside any flight hazard area.

\(ii\) All populations located within five-sigma left and right crossrange of a nominal trajectory instantaneous impact point ground trace and within five-sigma of each planned nominal debris impact.

\(3\) A debris risk analysis must account for both inert and explosive debris hazards produced from any impacting debris caused by normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight. The analysis must account for the debris classes determined by the debris analysis required by section A417.11. A debris risk analysis must account for any inert debris impact with mean expected kinetic energy at impact greater than or equal to 11 ft-lbs and peak incident overpressure of greater than or equal to 1.0 psi due to any explosive debris impact. The analysis must account for all debris hazards as a function of flight time.

\(4\) A debris risk analysis must account for debris impact points and dispersion for each class of debris in accordance with the following:

\(i\) A debris risk analysis must account for drag corrected impact points and dispersions for each class of impacting debris resulting from normal and malfunctioning launch vehicle flight as a function of trajectory time from lift-off through final impact.

\(ii\) The dispersion for each debris class must account for the position and velocity state vector dispersions at breakup, the variance produced by breakup imparted velocities, the effects of winds on both the ascent trajectory state vector at breakup and the descending debris piece impact location, the variance produced by aerodynamic properties for each debris class, and any other dispersion variances.

\(iii\) A debris risk analysis must account for the survivability of debris fragments that are subject to reentry aerodynamic forces or heating. A debris class may be eliminated from the debris risk analysis if the launch operator demonstrates that the debris will not survive to impact.

\(5\) A debris risk analysis must account for launch vehicle failure probability. The following constraints apply:

\(i\) For flight safety analysis purposes, a failure occurs when a vehicle does not complete any phase of normal flight or exhibits the potential for the stage or its debris to impact the Earth or reenter the atmosphere during the mission or any future mission of similar vehicle capability. Also, either a launch incident or launch accident constitutes a failure.

\(ii\) For a launch vehicle with fewer than 2 flights completed, the analysis must use a reference value for the launch vehicle failure probability estimate equal to the upper limit of the 60% two-sided confidence limits of the binomial distribution for outcomes of all previous launches of vehicles developed and launched in similar circumstances. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate to account for the level of experience demonstrated by the launch operator and other factors that affects the probability of failure. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate for the second launch based on evidence obtained from the first flight of the vehicle.

\(iii\) For a launch vehicle with at least 2 flights completed, the analysis must use the reference value for the launch vehicle failure probability of Table C417-2 based on the outcomes of all previous launches of the vehicle. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate to account for evidence obtained from the flight history of the vehicle. Failure probability estimate adjustments to the reference value may account for the nature of launch outcomes in the flight history of the vehicle, corrective actions taken in response to a failure of the vehicle, or other vehicle modifications that may affect reliability. The FAA may adjust the failure probability estimate to account for the demonstrated quality of the engineering approach to launch vehicle processing. The analysis must use a final failure estimate within the confidence limits of Table C417-2.

\(A\) Values listed on the far left of Table C417-2 apply when no launch failures are experienced. Values on the far right apply when only launch failures are experienced. Values in between apply for flight histories that include both failures and successes.

\(B\) Reference values in Table C417-2 are shown in bold. The reference values are the median values between 60% two-sided confidence limits of the binomial distribution. For the special cases of zero or N failures in N launch attempts, the reference values may also be recognized as the median value between the 80% one-sided confidence limit of the binomial distribution and zero or one, respectively.

\(C\) Upper and lower confidence bounds in Table C417-2 are shown directly above and below each reference value. These confidence bounds are based on 60% two-sided confidence limits of the binomial distribution. For the special cases of zero or N failures in N launch attempts, the upper and lower confidence bounds are based on the 80% one-sided confidence limit, respectively.

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er25au06.013.pdf)

\(6\) A debris risk analysis must account for the dwell time of the instantaneous impact point ground trace over each populated or protected area being evaluated.

\(7\) A debris risk analysis must account for the three-sigma instantaneous impact point trajectory variations in left-crossrange, right-crossrange, uprange, and downrange as a function of trajectory time, due to launch vehicle performance variations as determined by the trajectory analysis performed as required by section C417.3.

\(8\) A debris risk analysis must account for the effective casualty area as a function of launch vehicle flight time for all impacting debris generated from a catastrophic launch vehicle malfunction event or a planned impact event. The effective casualty area must:

\(i\) Account for both payload and vehicle systems and subsystems debris;

\(ii\) Account for all debris fragments determined as part of a launch operator's debris analysis as required by section A417.11;

\(iii\) For each explosive debris fragment, account for a 1.0 psi blast overpressure radius and the projected debris effects for all potentially explosive debris; and

\(iv\) For each inert debris fragment, account for bounce, skip, slide, and splatter effects; or equal seven times the maximum projected area of the fragment.

\(9\) A debris risk analysis must account for current population density data obtained from a current population database for the region being evaluated or by estimating the current population using exponential population growth rate equations applied to the most current historical data available. The population model must define population centers that are similar enough to be described and treated as a single average set of characteristics without degrading the accuracy of the debris risk estimate.

\(c\) *Debris risk analysis products.* The products of a debris risk analysis that a launch operator must file with the FAA must include:

\(1\) A debris risk analysis report that provides the analysis input data, probabilistic risk determination methods, sample computations, and text or graphical charts that characterize the public risk to geographical areas for each launch.

\(3\) A discussion of each launch vehicle failure scenario accounted for in the analysis and the probability of occurrence, which may vary with flight time, for each failure scenario. This information must include failure scenarios where a launch vehicle:

\(i\) Flies within normal limits until some malfunction causes spontaneous breakup; and

\(ii\) Experiences malfunction turns.

\(4\) A population model applicable to the launch overflight regions that contains the following: Region identification, location of the center of each population center by geodetic latitude and longitude, total area, number of persons in each population center, and a description of the shelter characteristics within the population center.

\(5\) A description of the launch vehicle, including general information concerning the nature and purpose of the launch and an overview of the launch vehicle, including a scaled diagram of the general arrangement and dimensions of the vehicle. A launch operator's debris risk analysis products may reference other documentation filed with the FAA containing this information. The description must include:

# C417.11   Collision avoidance

\(a\) *General.* A flight safety analysis must include a collision avoidance analysis that satisfies the requirements of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.231   Collision avoidance analysis.|§417.231]]. This section applies to a launch operator obtaining a collision avoidance assessment from United States Strategic Command as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.231   Collision avoidance analysis.|§417.231]] and to the analysis products that the launch operator must file with the FAA as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§417.203]](e). United States Strategic Command refers to a collision avoidance analysis for a space launch as a conjunction on launch assessment.

\(b\) *Analysis not required.* A collision avoidance analysis is not required if the maximum altitude attainable by the launch operator's unguided suborbital launch vehicle is less than the altitude of the lowest manned or mannable orbiting object. The maximum altitude attainable means an optimized trajectory, assuming 3-sigma maximum performance, extended through fuel exhaustion of each stage, to achieve a maximum altitude.

\(c\) *Analysis constraints.* A launch operator must satisfy the following when obtaining and implementing the results of a collision avoidance analysis:

\(1\) A launch operator must provide United States Strategic Command with the launch window and trajectory data needed to perform a collision avoidance analysis for a launch as required by paragraph (d) of this section, at least 15 days before the first attempt at flight. The FAA will identify a launch operator to United States Strategic Command as part of issuing a license and provide a launch operator with current United States Strategic Command contact information.

\(2\) A launch operator must obtain a collision avoidance analysis performed by United States Strategic Command 6 hours before the beginning of a launch window.

\(3\) A launch operator may use a collision avoidance analysis for 12 hours from the time that United States Strategic Command determines the state vectors of the manned or mannable orbiting objects. If a launch operator needs an updated collision avoidance analysis due to a launch delay, the launch operator must file the request with United States Strategic Command at least 12 hours prior to the beginning of the new launch window.

\(4\) For every 90 minutes, or portion of 90 minutes, that pass between the time United States Strategic Command last determined the state vectors of the orbiting objects, a launch operator must expand each wait in a launch window by subtracting 15 seconds from the start of the wait in the launch window and adding 15 seconds to the end of the wait in the launch window. A launch operator must incorporate all the resulting waits in the launch window into its flight commit criteria established as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.113   Launch safety rules.|§417.113]].

\(d\) *Information required.* A launch operator must prepare a collision avoidance analysis worksheet for each launch using a standardized format that contains the input data required by this paragraph. A launch operator must file the input data with United States Strategic Command for the purposes of completing a collision avoidance analysis.

\(1\) *Launch information.* A launch operator must file the following launch information:

\(i\) *Mission name.* A mnemonic given to the launch vehicle/payload combination identifying the launch mission from all others.

\(ii\) *Segment number.* A segment is defined as a launch vehicle stage or payload after the thrusting portion of its flight has ended. This includes the jettison or deployment of any stage or payload. A launch operator must provide a separate worksheet for each segment.

# D417.1   General

This appendix applies to each flight termination system and the components that make up the system for each launch. Section 417.301 requires that a launch operator's flight safety system include a flight termination system that complies with this appendix. Section 417.301 also contains requirements that apply to a launch operator's demonstration of compliance with the requirements of this appendix.

# D417.3   Flight termination system functional requirements

\(a\) When a flight safety system terminates the flight of a vehicle because it has either violated a flight safety rule as defined in [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.113   Launch safety rules.|§417.113]] or the vehicle inadvertently separates or destructs as described in section D417.11, a flight termination system must:

\(1\) Render each propulsion system that has the capability of reaching a populated or other protected area, incapable of propulsion, without significant lateral or longitudinal deviation in the impact point. This includes each stage and any strap on motor or propulsion system that is part of any payload;

\(2\) Terminate the flight of any inadvertently or prematurely separated propulsion system capable of reaching a populated or other protected area;

\(3\) Destroy the pressure integrity of any solid propellant system to terminate all thrust or ensure that any residual thrust causes the propulsion system to tumble without significant lateral or longitudinal deviation in the impact point; and

\(4\) Disperse any liquid propellant, whether by rupturing the propellant tank or other equivalent method, and initiate burning of any toxic liquid propellant.

\(b\) A flight termination system must not cause any solid or liquid propellant to detonate.

\(c\) The flight termination of a propulsion system must not interfere with the flight termination of any other propulsion system.

Each redundant component's mounting on a launch vehicle, including location or orientation, must ensure that any failure that will damage, destroy or otherwise inhibit the operation of one redundant component will not inhibit the operation of the other redundant component and will not inhibit functioning of the system. Each of the following exceptions applies:

### Appendix F to Part 417 \[Reserved\]

### Appendix G to Part 417—Natural and Triggered Lightning Flight Commit Criteria

# G417.1   General

This appendix provides flight commit criteria for mitigating against natural lightning strikes and lightning triggered by the flight of a launch vehicle through or near an electrified environment. A launch operator may not initiate flight unless the weather conditions at the time of launch satisfy all lightning flight commit criteria of this appendix.

\(a\) In order to meet the lightning flight commit criteria, a launch operator must employ any:

\(1\) Weather monitoring and measuring equipment needed, and

\(2\) Procedures needed to verify compliance.

\(b\) When equipment or procedures, such as a field mill or calculation of the volume-averaged, height-integrated radar reflectivity (VAHIRR) of clouds, are used with the lightning flight commit criteria to increase launch opportunities, a launch operator must evaluate all applicable measurements to determine whether the measurements satisfy the criteria. A launch operator may not turn off available instrumentation to create the appearance of meeting a requirement and must use all radar reflectivity measurements within a specified volume for a VAHIRR calculation.

\(c\) If a launch operator proposes any alternative lightning flight commit criteria, the launch operator must clearly and convincingly demonstrate that the alternative provides an equivalent level of safety to that required by this appendix.

# G417.25   Measurement of Cloud Radar Reflectivity, Computation of VAHIRR, and Measurement of Electric Field

\(a\) *Radar reflectivity measurement.* A launch operator who measures radar reflectivity to comply with this appendix must employ a meteorological radar and ensure that—

\(1\) The radar wavelength is greater than or equal to 5 cm;

\(2\) A reflectivity measurement is due to a meteorological target;

\(3\) The spatial accuracy and resolution of a reflectivity measurement is 1 kilometer or better;

\(4\) Any attenuation caused by intervening precipitation or by an accumulation of water or ice on the radome is less than or equal to 1 dBZ; and

\(5\) A reflectivity measurement contains no portion of the cone of silence above the radar antenna, nor any portion of any sector that is blocked out for payload safety reasons.

\(b\) *Computation of VAHIRR.* A launch operator who measures VAHIRR to comply with this appendix must ensure that—

\(1\) A digital signal processor provides radar reflectivity measurements on a three-dimensional Cartesian grid having a maximum grid-point-to-grid-point spacing of one kilometer in each of the three dimensions;

\(2\) The specified volume is the volume bounded in the horizontal by vertical, plane, perpendicular sides located 5.5 kilometers (3 nautical miles) north, east, south, and west of the point where VAHIRR is to be evaluated; on the bottom by the 0 degree Celsius level; and on the top by an altitude of 20 kilometers;

\(3\) Volume-averaged radar reflectivity is the arithmetic average of the radar reflectivity measurements in dBZ at grid points within the specified volume. A launch operator must include each grid point within the specified volume in the average if and only if that grid point has a radar reflectivity measurement equal to or greater than 0 dBZ. If fewer than 10% of the grid points in the specified volume have radar reflectivity measurements equal to or greater than 0 dBZ, then the volume-averaged radar reflectivity is either the maximum radar reflectivity measurement in the specified volume, or 0 dBZ, whichever is greater.

\(4\) Average cloud thickness is the difference in kilometers or thousands of feet between an average top and an average base of all clouds in the specified volume, computed as follows:

\(i\) The cloud base to be averaged is the higher, at each horizontal position, of either

\(A\) The 0 degree Celsius altitude, or

\(B\) The lowest altitude of all radar reflectivity measurements of 0 dBZ or greater.

\(ii\) The cloud top to be averaged is the highest altitude of all radar reflectivity measurements of 0 dBZ or greater at each horizontal position.

\(iii\) A launch operator must—

\(A\) Take the cloud base at any horizontal position as the altitude of the corresponding base grid point minus half of the grid-point vertical separation;

\(B\) Take the cloud top at that horizontal position as the altitude of the corresponding top grid point plus half of this vertical separation.

\(5\) All VAHIRR-evaluation points in the flight path itself are:

\(i\) Greater than a slant distance of 10 nautical miles from any radar reflectivity of 35 dBZ or greater at altitudes of 4 kilometers or greater above mean sea level; and

\(ii\) Greater than a slant distance of 10 nautical miles from any type of lightning that has occurred in the previous 5 minutes.

\(iii\) A launch operator need not apply paragraph (b)(5) of this section to VAHIRR evaluation points outside the flight path but within one nautical mile of the flight path.

\(6\) VAHIRR is the product, expressed in units of dBZ-km or dBZ-kft, of the volume-averaged radar reflectivity defined in paragraph (b)(3) of this section and the average cloud thickness defined in paragraph (b)(4) of this section in the specified volume defined in paragraph (b)(2) of this section.

\(3\) Ensure that all field mills are calibrated so that the polarity of the electric field measurements is the same as the polarity of a voltage placed on a test plate above the sensor,

\(4\) Ensure that the altitude of the flight path of the launch vehicle is equal to or less than 20 kilometers (66 thousand feet) everywhere above a horizontal circle of 5 nautical miles centered on the field mill being used,

### Appendix H to Part 417 \[Reserved\]

### Appendix I to Part 417—Methodologies for Toxic Release Hazard Analysis and Operational Procedures

# I417.1   General

This appendix provides methodologies for performing toxic release hazard analysis for the flight of a launch vehicle as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.227   Toxic release hazard analysis.|§417.227]] and for launch processing at a launch site in the United States as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.407   Hazard control implementation.|§417.407]](f). The requirements of this appendix apply to a launch operator and the launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis unless the launch operator clearly and convincingly demonstrates that an alternative approach provides an equivalent level of safety.

# I417.3   Identification of non-toxic and toxic propellants

\(a\) *General.* A launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis for launch vehicle flight (section I417.5) and for launch processing (section I417.7) must identify all propellants used for each launch and identify whether each propellant is toxic or non-toxic as required by this section.

\(b\) *Non-toxic exclusion.* A launch operator need not conduct a toxic release hazard analysis under this appendix for flight or launch processing if its launch vehicle, including all launch vehicle components and payloads, uses only those propellants listed in Table I417-1.

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er25au06.099.pdf)

\(c\) *Identification of toxic propellants.* A launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis for flight and for launch processing must identify all toxic propellants used for each launch, including all toxic propellants on all launch vehicle components and payloads. Table I417-2 lists commonly used toxic propellants and the associated toxic concentration thresholds used by the Federal launch ranges for controlling potential public exposure. The toxic concentration thresholds contained in Table I417-2 are peak exposure concentrations in parts per million (ppm). A launch operator must perform a toxic release hazard analysis to ensure that the public is not exposed to concentrations above the toxic concentration thresholds for each toxicant involved in a launch. A launch operator must use the toxic concentration thresholds contained in table I417-2 for those propellants. Any propellant not identified in table I417-1 or table I417-2 falls into the category of unique or uncommon propellants, such as those identified in table I417-3, which are toxic or produce toxic combustion by-products. Table I417.3 is not an exhaustive list of possible toxic propellants and combustion by-products. For a launch that uses any propellant listed in table I417-3 or any other unique propellant not listed, a launch operator must identify the chemical composition of the propellant and all combustion by-products and the release scenarios. A launch operator must determine the toxic concentration threshold in ppm for any uncommon toxic propellant or combustion by-product in accordance with the following:

\(1\) For a toxicant that has a level of concern (LOC) established by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), or Department of Transportation (DOT), a launch operator must use the LOC as the toxic concentration threshold for the toxic release hazard analysis except as required by paragraph (c)(2) of this section.

\(2\) If an EPA acute emergency guidance level (AEGL) exists for a toxicant and is more conservative than the LOC (that is, lower after reduction for duration of exposure), a launch operator must use the AEGL instead of the LOC as the toxic concentration threshold.

\(3\) A launch operator must use the EPA's Hazard Quotient/Hazard Index (HQ/HI) formulation to determine the toxic concentration threshold for mixtures of two or more toxicants.

\(4\) If a launch operator must determine a toxic concentration threshold for a toxicant for which an LOC has not been established, the launch operator must clearly and convincingly demonstrate through the licensing process that public exposure at the proposed toxic concentration threshold will not cause a casualty.

# I417.5   Toxic release hazard analysis for launch vehicle flight

\(a\) *General.* For each launch, a launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis must determine all hazards to the public from any toxic release that will occur during the proposed flight of a launch vehicle or that would occur in the event of a flight mishap. A launch operator must use the results of the toxic release hazard analysis to establish for each launch, in accordance with [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.113   Launch safety rules.|§417.113]](c), flight commit criteria that protect the public from a casualty arising out of any potential toxic release. A launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis must determine if toxic release can occur based on an evaluation of the propellants, launch vehicle materials, and estimated combustion products. This evaluation must account for both normal combustion products and the chemical composition of any unreacted propellants.

\(b\) *Evaluating toxic hazards for launch vehicle flight.* Each launch must satisfy either the exclusion requirements of section I417.3(b), the containment requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, or the statistical risk management requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, to prevent any casualty that could arise out of exposure to any toxic release.

\(c\) *Toxic containment for launch vehicle flight.* For a launch that uses any toxic propellant, a launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis must determine a hazard distance for each toxicant and a toxic hazard area for the launch. A hazard distance for a toxicant is the furthest distance from the launch point where toxic concentrations may be greater than the toxicant's toxic concentration threshold in the event of a release during flight. A launch operator must determine the toxic hazard distance for each toxicant as required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section. A toxic hazard area defines the region on the Earth's surface that may be exposed to toxic concentrations greater than any toxic concentration threshold of any toxicant involved in a launch in the event of a release during flight. A launch operator must determine a toxic hazard area in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section. In order to achieve containment, a launch operator must evacuate the public from a toxic hazard area as required by paragraph (c)(4) of this section or employ meteorological constraints as required by paragraph (c)(5) of this section. A launch operator must determine the hazard distance for a quantity of toxic propellant and determine and implement a toxic hazard area for a launch as follows:

\(1\) *Hazard distances for common propellants.* Table I417-4 lists toxic hazard distances as a function of propellant quantity and toxic concentration threshold for commonly used propellants released from a catastrophic launch vehicle failure. Tables I417-10 and I417-11 list the hazard distance as a function of solid propellant mass for HC1 emissions during a launch vehicle failure and during normal flight for ammonium perchlorate based solid propellants. A launch operator must use the hazard distances corresponding to the toxic concentration thresholds established for a launch to determine the toxic hazard area for the launch in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section.

\(2\) *Hazard distances for uncommon or unique propellants.* For a launch that involves any uncommon or unique propellant, a launch operator must determine the toxic hazard distance for each such propellant using an analysis methodology that accounts for the following worst case conditions:

\(i\) Surface wind speed of 2.9 knots with a wind speed increase of 1.0 knot per 1000 feet of altitude.

\(ii\) Surface temperature of 32 degrees Fahrenheit with a dry bulb temperature lapse rate of 13.7 degrees Fahrenheit per 1000 feet over the first 500 feet of altitude and a lapse rate of 3.0 degrees F per 1000 feet above 500 feet.

\(iii\) Directional wind shear of 2 degrees per 1000 feet of altitude.

\(iv\) Relative humidity of 50 percent.

\(v\) Capping temperature inversion at the thermally stabilized exhaust cloud center of mass altitude.

\(vi\) Worst case initial source term assuming instantaneous release of fully loaded propellant storage tanks or pressurized motor segments.

\(vii\) Worst case combustion or mixing ratios such that production of toxic chemical species is maximized within the bounds of reasonable uncertainties.

\(viii\) Evaluation of toxic hazards for both normal launch and vehicle abort failure modes.

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/er25au06.104.pdf)

\(3\) *Toxic hazard area.* Having determined the toxic hazard distance for each toxicant, a launch operator must determine the toxic hazard area for a launch as a circle centered at the launch point with a radius equal to the greatest toxic hazard distance determined as required by paragraphs (c)(1) and (c)(2) of this section, of all the toxicants involved in the launch. A launch operator does not have to satisfy paragraph (c)(3) of this section if:

\(i\) The launch operator demonstrates that there are no populated areas contained or partially contained within the toxic hazard area; and

\(ii\) The launch operator ensures that no member of the public is present within the toxic hazard area during preflight fueling, launch countdown, flight and immediate postflight operations at the launch site. To ensure the absence of the public, a launch operator must develop flight commit criteria and related provisions for implementation as part of the launch operator's flight safety plan and hazard area surveillance and clearance plan developed under [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.111   Launch plans.|§§417.111]](b) and 417.111(j), respectively.

\(4\) *Evacuation of populated areas within a toxic hazard area.* For a launch where there is a populated area that is contained or partially contained within a toxic hazard area, the launch operator does not have to satisfy paragraph (c)(5) of this section if the launch operator evacuates all people from all populated areas at risk and ensures that no member of the public is present within the toxic hazard area during preflight fueling and flight. A launch operator must develop flight commit criteria and provisions for implementation of the evacuations as part of the launch operator's flight safety plan, hazard area surveillance and clearance plan, and local agreements and public coordination plan developed according to [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.111   Launch plans.|§§417.111]](b), 417.111(j) and 417.111(i), respectively.

\(5\) *Flight meteorological constraints.* For a launch where there is a populated area that is contained or partially contained within a toxic hazard area and that will not be evacuated under paragraph (c)(4) of this section, the launch is exempt from any further requirements of this section if the launch operator constrains the flight of a launch vehicle to favorable wind conditions or during times when atmospheric conditions result in reduced toxic hazard distances such that any potentially affected populated area is outside the toxic hazard area. A launch operator must employ wind and other meteorological constraints as follows:

\(i\) When employing wind constraints, a launch operator must re-define the toxic hazard area by reducing the circular toxic hazard area determined under paragraph (c)(3) of this section to one or more arc segments that do not contain any populated area. Each arc segment toxic hazard area must have the same radius as the circular toxic hazard area and must be defined by a range of downwind bearings.

\(ii\) The launch operator must demonstrate that there are no populated areas within any arc segment toxic hazard area and that no member of the public is present within an arc segment toxic hazard area during preflight fueling, launch countdown, and immediate postflight operations at the launch site.

\(iii\) A launch operator must establish wind constraints to ensure that any winds present at the time of flight will transport any toxicant into an arc segment toxic hazard area and away from any populated area. For each arc segment toxic hazard area, the wind constraints must consist of a range of downwind bearings that are within the arc segment toxic hazard area and that provide a safety buffer, in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions, that accounts for any uncertainty in the spatial and temporal variations of the transport winds. When determining the wind uncertainty, a launch operator must account for the variance of the mean wind directions derived from measurements of the winds through the first 6000 feet in altitude at the launch point. Each clockwise and counterclockwise safety buffer must be no less than 20 degrees of arc width within the arc segment toxic hazard area. A launch operator must ensure that the wind conditions at the time of flight satisfy the wind constraints. To accomplish this, a launch operator must monitor the launch site vertical profile of winds from the altitude of the launch point to no less than 6,000 feet above ground level. The launch operator must proceed with a launch only if all wind vectors within this vertical range satisfy the wind constraints. A launch operator must develop wind constraint flight commit criteria and implementation provisions as part of the launch operator's flight safety plan and its hazard area surveillance and clearance plan developed according to [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.111   Launch plans.|§§417.111]](b) and 417.111(j), respectively.

\(iv\) A launch operator may reduce the radius of the circular toxic hazard area determined in accordance with paragraph (c)(3) of this section by imposing operational meteorological restrictions on specific parameters that mitigate potential toxic downwind concentrations levels at any potentially affected populated area to levels below the toxic concentration threshold of each toxicant in question. The launch operator must establish meteorological constraints to ensure that flight will be allowed to occur only if the specific meteorological conditions that would reduce the toxic hazard area exist and will continue to exist throughout the flight.

\(d\) *Statistical toxic risk management for flight.* If a launch that involves the use of a toxic propellant does not satisfy the containment requirements of paragraph (c) of this section, the launch operator must use statistical toxic risk management to protect public safety. For each such case, a launch operator must perform a toxic risk assessment and develop launch commit criteria that protect the public from unacceptable risk due to planned and potential toxic release. A launch operator must ensure that the resultant toxic risk meets the collective and individual risk criteria requirements contained in [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](b). A launch operator's toxic risk assessment must account for the following:

\(1\) All credible vehicle failure and non-failure modes, along with the consequent release and combustion of propellants and other vehicle combustible materials.

\(2\) All vehicle failure rates.

\(3\) The effect of positive or negative buoyancy on the rise or descent of each released toxicant.

\(4\) The influence of atmospheric physics on the transport and diffusion of each toxicant.

\(5\) Meteorological conditions at the time of launch.

\(6\) Population density, location, susceptibility (health categories) and sheltering for all populations within each potential toxic hazard area.

\(7\) Exposure duration and toxic propellant concentration or dosage that would result in casualty for all populations.

\(e\) *Flight toxic release hazard analysis products.* The products of a launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis for launch vehicle flight to be filed in accordance with [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.203   Compliance.|§417.203]](e) must include the following:

\(1\) For each launch, a listing of all propellants used on all launch vehicle components and any payloads.

\(2\) The chemical composition of each toxic propellant and all toxic combustion products.

\(3\) The quantities of each toxic propellant and all toxic combustion products involved in the launch.

\(4\) For each toxic propellant and combustion product, identification of the toxic concentration threshold used in the toxic risk analysis and a description of how the toxic concentration threshold was determined if other than specified in table I417.2.

\(5\) When using the toxic containment approach of paragraph (c) of this section:

\(i\) The hazard distance for each toxic propellant and combustion product and a description of how it was determined.

\(ii\) A graphic depiction of the toxic hazard area or areas.

\(iii\) A listing of any wind or other constraints on flight, and any plans for evacuation.

\(iv\) A description of how the launch operator determines real-time wind direction in relation to the launch site and any populated area and any other meteorological condition in order to implement constraints on flight or to implement evacuation plans.

\(6\) When using the statistical toxic risk management approach of paragraph (d) of this section:

\(i\) A description of the launch operator's toxic risk management process, including an explanation of how the launch operator ensures that any toxic risk from launch meets the toxic risk criteria of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](b).

\(ii\) A listing of all models used.

\(iii\) A listing of all flight commit criteria that protect the public from unacceptable risk due to planned and potential toxic release.

\(iv\) A description of how the launch operator measures and displays real-time meteorological conditions in order to determine whether conditions at the time of flight are within the envelope of those used by the launch operator for toxic risk assessment and to develop flight commit criteria, or for use in any real-time physics models used to ensure compliance with the toxic flight commit criteria.

# I417.7   Toxic release hazard analysis for launch processing

\(a\) *General.* A launch operator must perform a toxic release hazard analysis to determine potential public hazards from toxic releases that will occur during normal launch processing and that will occur in the event of a mishap during launch processing. This section implements the ground safety requirements of [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.407   Hazard control implementation.|§417.407]](g). A launch operator must use the results of the toxic release hazard analysis to establish hazard controls for protecting the public. A launch operator must include the toxic release hazard analysis results in the ground safety plan as required by [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.111   Launch plans.|§417.111]](c).

\(b\) *Process hazards analysis.* A launch operator must perform an analysis on all processes to identify toxic hazards and determine the potential for release of a toxic propellant. The analysis must account for the complexity of the process and must identify and evaluate the hazards and each hazard control involved in the process. An analysis that complies with 29 CFR 1910.119(e) satisfies paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this section. A launch operator's process hazards analysis must include the following:

\(1\) Identify and evaluate each hazard of a process involving a toxic propellant using an analysis method, such as a failure mode and effects analysis or fault tree analysis.

\(2\) Describe:

\(i\) Each toxic hazard associated with the process and the potential for release of toxic propellants;

\(ii\) Each mishap or incident experienced which has a potential for catastrophic consequences;

\(iii\) Each engineering and administrative control applicable to each hazard and their interrelationships, such as application of detection methodologies to provide early warning of releases and evacuation of toxic hazard areas prior to conducting an operation that involves a toxicant;

\(iv\) Consequences of failure of engineering and administrative controls;

\(v\) Location of the source of the release;

\(vi\) All human factors;

\(vii\) Each opportunity for equipment malfunction or human error that can cause an accidental release;

\(viii\) Each safeguard used or needed to control each hazard or prevent equipment malfunctions or human error;

\(ix\) Each step or procedure needed to detect or monitor releases; and

\(x\) A qualitative evaluation of a range of the possible safety and health effects of failure of controls.

\(3\) The process hazards analysis must be updated for each launch. The launch operator must conduct a review of all the hazards associated with each process involving a toxic propellant for launch processing. The review must include inspection of equipment to determine whether the process is designed, fabricated, maintained, and operated according to the current process hazards analysis. A launch operator must revise a process hazards analysis to reflect changes in processes, types of toxic propellants stored or handled, or other aspects of a source of a potential toxic release that can affect the results of overall toxic release hazard analysis.

\(4\) The personnel who perform a process hazard analysis must possess expertise in engineering and process operations, and at least one person must have experience and knowledge specific to the process being evaluated. At least one person must be knowledgeable in the specific process hazard analysis methodology being used.

\(5\) A launch operator must resolve all recommendations resulting from a process hazards analysis in a timely manner prior to launch processing and the resolution must be documented. The documentation must identify each corrective action and include a written schedule of when any such actions are to be completed.

\(c\) *Evaluating toxic hazards of launch processing.* A launch operator must protect the public from each potential toxic hazard identified by the process hazards analysis required by paragraph (b) of this section, the exclusion requirements of section I417.3(b), the containment requirements of paragraph (d) of this section, or the statistical risk management requirements of paragraph (l) of this section, to prevent any casualty that could arise out of exposure to any toxic release.

\(d\) *Toxic containment for launch processing.* A launch operator's toxic release hazard analysis must determine a toxic hazard area surrounding the potential release site for each toxic propellant based on the amount and toxicity of the propellant and the meteorological conditions involved. A launch operator must determine whether there are populated areas located within a toxic hazard area that satisfy paragraph (h) of this section. If necessary to achieve toxic containment, a launch operator must evacuate the public in order to satisfy paragraph (i) of this section or employ meteorological constraints that satisfy paragraph (j) of this section. A launch operator, in determining a toxic hazard area, must first perform a worst-case release scenario analysis that satisfies paragraph (e) of this section or a worst-case alternative release scenario analysis that satisfies paragraph (f) of this section for each process that involves a toxic propellant. The launch operator must then determine a toxic hazard distance for each process that satisfies paragraph (g) of this section.

\(e\) *Worst-case release scenario analysis.* A launch operator's worst-case release scenario analysis must account for the following:

\(1\) *Determination of worst-case release quantity.* A launch operator must determine the worst-case release quantity of a toxic propellant by selecting the greater of the following:

\(i\) For substances in a vessel, the greatest amount held in a single vessel, accounting for administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity; or

\(ii\) For toxic propellants in pipes, the greatest amount in a pipe, accounting for administrative controls that limit the maximum quantity.

\(2\) *Worst-case release scenario for toxic liquids.* A launch operator must determine the worst-case release scenario for a toxic liquid propellant as follows:

\(i\) A launch operator must assume that for toxic propellants that are normally liquids at ambient temperature, the quantity in the vessel or pipe, as determined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool.

\(ii\) The launch operator must determine surface area of the pool by assuming that the liquid spreads to one centimeter deep unless passive mitigation systems are in place that serve to contain the spill and limit the surface area. Where passive mitigation is in place, the launch operator must use the surface area of the contained liquid to calculate the volatilization rate.

\(iii\) If the release occurs on a surface that is not paved or smooth, the launch operator may account for actual surface characteristics.

\(iv\) The volatilization rate must account for the highest daily maximum temperature occurring in the past three years, the temperature of the substance in the vessel, and the concentration of the toxic propellants if the liquid spilled is a mixture or solution.

\(v\) The launch operator must determine rate of release to the air from the volatilization rate of the liquid pool. A launch operator must use either the methodology provided in the Risk Management Plan (RMP) Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, dated April 1999, available at *http://www.epa.gov/swercepp/ap-ocgu.htm*, or an air dispersion modeling technique that satisfies paragraph (g) of this section.

\(3\) *Worst-case release scenario for toxic gases.* A launch operator must determine the worst-case release scenario for a toxic gas as follows:

\(i\) For toxic propellants that are normally gases at ambient temperature and handled as a gas or as a liquid under pressure, the launch operator must assume that the quantity in the vessel, or pipe, as determined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, is released as a gas over 10 minutes. The launch operator must assume a release rate that is the total quantity divided by 10 unless passive mitigation systems are in place.

\(ii\) For gases handled as refrigerated liquids at ambient pressure, if the released toxic propellant is not contained by passive mitigation systems or if the contained pool would have a depth of 1 cm or less, the launch operator must assume that the toxic propellant is released as a gas in 10 minutes.

\(iii\) For gases handled as refrigerated liquids at ambient pressure, if the released toxic propellant is contained by passive mitigation systems in a pool with a depth greater than 1 cm, the launch operator must assume that the quantity in the vessel or pipe, as defined in paragraph (e)(1) of this section, is spilled instantaneously to form a liquid pool. The launch operator must calculate the volatilization rate at the boiling point of the toxic propellant and at the conditions defined in paragraph (e)(2) of this section.

\(4\) *Consideration of passive mitigation.* The launch operator must account for passive mitigation systems in the analysis of a worst case release scenario if the passive mitigation system is capable of withstanding the release event triggering the scenario and would function as intended.

\(5\) *Additional factors in selecting a worst-case scenario.* A launch operator's worst-case release scenario for a toxic propellant must account for each factor that would result in a greater toxic hazard distance, such as a smaller quantity of the toxic propellant than required by paragraph (e)(1) of this section, that is handled at a higher process temperature or pressure.

\(f\) *Worst-case alternative release scenario analysis.* A launch operator's worst-case alternative release scenario analysis must account for the following:

\(1\) The worst-case release scenario for each toxic propellant and for each toxic propellant handling process;

\(2\) Each release event that is more likely to occur than the worst-case release scenario that is determined in paragraph (e) of this section;

\(3\) Each release scenario that exceeds a toxic concentration threshold at a distance that reaches the general public;

\(4\) Each potential transfer hose release due to splits or sudden hose uncoupling;

\(5\) Each potential process piping release from failures at flanges, joints, welds, valves, valve seals, and drain bleeds;

\(6\) Each potential process vessel or pump release due to cracks, seal failure, or drain, bleed, or plug failure;

\(7\) Each vessel overfilling and spill, or over pressurization and venting through relief valves or rupture disks;

\(8\) Shipping container mishandling and breakage or puncturing leading to a spill;

\(9\) Mishandling or dropping flight or ground hardware that contains toxic commodities;

\(10\) Each active and passive mitigation system provided they are capable of withstanding the event that triggered the release and would still be functional;

\(11\) History of each accident experienced by the launch operator involving the release of a toxic propellant; and

\(12\) Each failure scenario.

\(g\) *Toxic hazard distances for launch processing.* For each process involving a toxic propellant, a launch operator must perform an air dispersion analysis to determine the hazard distance for the worst-case release scenario or the worst-case alternative release scenario as determined under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section. A launch operator must use either the methodology provided in the RMP Offsite Consequence Analysis Guidance, dated April 1999, or an air dispersion modeling technique that is applicable to the proposed launch. A launch operator's air dispersion modeling technique must account for the following analysis parameters:

\(1\) *Toxic concentration thresholds.* A launch operator must use the toxic concentration thresholds defined by section I417.3(c).

\(2\) *Wind speed and atmospheric stability class.* A launch operator, for the worst-case release analysis, must use a wind speed of 1.5 meters per second and atmospheric stability class F. If the launch operator demonstrates that local meteorological data applicable to the source of a toxic release show a higher wind minimum wind speed or less stable atmosphere during the three previous years, the launch operator may use these minimums. The launch operator, for analysis of the worst-case alternative scenario, must use statistical meteorological conditions for the location of the source.

\(3\) *Ambient temperature and humidity.* For a worst-case release scenario analysis of a toxic propellant, the launch operator must use the highest daily maximum temperature from the last three years and average humidity for the site, based on temperature and humidity data gathered at the source location or at a local meteorological station. For analysis of a worst-case alternative release scenario, the launch operator must use typical temperature and humidity data gathered at the source location or at a local meteorological station.

\(4\) *Height of release.* The launch operator must analyze the worst-case release of a toxic propellant assuming a ground level release. For a worst-case alternative scenario analysis of a toxic propellant, the release scenario may determine release height.

\(5\) *Surface roughness.* The launch operator must use either an urban or rural topography, as appropriate. Urban means that there are many obstacles in the immediate area; obstacles include buildings or trees. Rural means there are no buildings in the immediate area and the terrain is generally flat and unobstructed.

\(6\) *Dense or neutrally buoyant gases.* Models or tables used for dispersion analysis of a toxic propellant must account for gas density.

\(7\) *Temperature of release substance.* For a worst-case release scenario, the launch operator must account for the release of liquids other than gases liquefied by refrigeration at the highest daily maximum temperature, based on data for the previous three years appropriate to the source of the potential toxic release, or at process temperature, whichever is higher. For a worst-case alternative scenario, the launch operator may consider toxic propellants released at a process or ambient temperature that is appropriate for the scenario.

\(h\) *Toxic hazard areas for launch processing.* A launch operator, having determined the toxic hazard distance for the toxic concentration threshold for each toxic propellant involved in a process using either a worst-case release scenario or a worst-case alternative release scenario, must determine the toxic hazard area for the process as a circle centered at the potential release point with a radius equal to the greatest toxic hazard distance for the toxic propellants involved in the process. A launch operator does not have to satisfy this section if:

\(1\) There are no populated areas contained or partially contained within the toxic hazard area; and

\(2\) There is no member of the public present within the toxic hazard area during the process.

\(i\) *Evacuation of populated areas within a toxic hazard area.* For a process where there is a populated area that is contained or partially contained within the toxic hazard area, the launch processing operation does not have to satisfy this section if the launch operator evacuates the public from the populated area and ensures that no member of the public is present within the toxic hazard area during the operation. A launch operator must coordinate notification and evacuation procedures with the Local Emergency Planning Committee (LEPC) and ensure that notification and evacuation occurs according to its launch plans, including the launch operator's ground safety plan, hazard area surveillance and clearance plan, accident investigation plan, and local agreements and public coordination plan.

\(j\) *Meteorological constraints for launch processing.* For a launch processing operation with the potential for a toxic release where there is a populated area that is contained or partially contained within the toxic hazard area and that will not be evacuated as required by paragraph (i) of this section, the operation is exempt from further requirements in this section if the launch operator constrains the process to favorable wind conditions or during times when atmospheric conditions result in reduced toxic hazard distances such that the potentially affected populated area is outside the toxic hazard area. A launch operator must employ wind and other meteorological constraints that satisfy the following:

\(1\) A launch operator must limit a launch processing operation to times during which prevailing winds will transport a toxic release away from populated areas that would otherwise be at risk. If the mean wind speed during the operation is equal to or greater than four knots, the launch operator must re-define the toxic hazard area by reducing the circular toxic hazard area as determined in paragraph (h) of this section to one or more arc segments that do not contain a populated area. Each arc segment toxic hazard area must have the same radius as the circular toxic hazard area and must be defined by a range of downwind bearings. If the mean wind speed during the operation is less than four knots, the toxic hazard area for the operation must be the full 360-degree toxic hazard area as defined by paragraph (h) of this section. The total arc width of an arc segment hazard area for launch processing must be greater than or equal to 30 degrees. If the launch operator determines the standard deviation of the measured wind direction, the total arc width of an arc segment hazard area must include all azimuths within the mean measured wind direction plus three sigma and the mean measured wind direction minus three sigma; otherwise, the following apply for the conditions defined by the Pasquil-Gifford meteorological stability classes:

\(i\) For stable classes D-F, if the mean wind speed is less than 10 knots, the total arc width of the arc segment toxic hazard area must be no less than 90 degrees;

\(ii\) For stable classes D-F, if the mean wind speed is greater than or equal to 10 knots, the total arc width of the arc segment toxic hazard area must be no less than 45 degrees;

\(iii\) For neutral class C, the total arc width of the arc segment toxic hazard area must be no less than 60 degrees;

\(iv\) For slightly unstable class B, the total arc width of the arc segment toxic hazard area must be no less than 105 degrees; and

\(v\) For mostly unstable class A, the total arc width of the arc segment toxic hazard area must be no less than 150 degrees.

\(2\) The launch operator must ensure that there are no populated areas within an arc segment toxic hazard area and that no member of the public is present within an arc segment toxic hazard area during the process as defined by paragraph (i) of this section.

\(3\) A launch operator must establish wind constraints to ensure that winds present at the time of an operation will transport toxicants into an arc segment toxic hazard area and away from populated areas. For each arc segment toxic hazard area, the wind constraints must consist of a range of downwind bearings that are within the arc segment toxic hazard area and that provide a safety buffer, in both the clockwise and counterclockwise directions, that accounts for uncertainty in the spatial and temporal variations of the transport winds.

\(4\) A launch operator may reduce the radius of the circular toxic hazard area as determined under paragraph (h) of this section by imposing operational meteorological restrictions on specific parameters that mitigate potential toxic downwind concentrations levels at a potentially affected populated area to levels below the toxic concentration threshold of the toxicant in question. The launch operator must establish meteorological constraints to ensure that the operation will be allowed to occur only if the specific meteorological conditions that would reduce the toxic hazard area exist and will continue to exist throughout the operation, or the operation will be terminated.

\(k\) *Implementation of meteorological constraints.* A launch operator must use one or more of the following approaches to determine wind direction or other meteorological conditions in order to establish constraints on a launch processing operation or evacuate the populated area in a potential toxic hazard area:

\(1\) The launch operator must ensure that the wind conditions at the time of the process comply with the wind constraints used to define each arc segment toxic hazard area. The launch operator must monitor the vertical profile of winds at the potential toxic release site from ground level to an altitude of 10 meters or the maximum height above ground of the potential release, whichever is larger. The launch operator may proceed with a launch processing operation only if wind vectors meet the wind constraints used to define each arc segment toxic hazard area.

\(2\) A launch operator must monitor the specific meteorological parameters that affect toxic downwind concentrations at a potential toxic release site for a process and for the sphere of influence out to each populated area within the potential toxic hazard area as defined by paragraph (h) of this section. The launch operator must monitor spatial variations in the wind field that could affect the transport of toxic material between the potential release site and populated areas. The launch operator must acquire real-time meteorological data from sites between the potential release site and each populated area sufficient to demonstrate that the toxic hazard area, when adjusted to the spatial wind field variations, excludes populated areas. Meteorological parameters that affect toxic downwind concentrations from the potential release site and covering the sphere of influence out to the populated areas must fall within the conditions as determined in paragraph (j)(4) of this section. A launch operator must use one of the following methods to determine the meteorological conditions that will constrain a launch processing operation:

\(i\) A launch operator may employ real-time air dispersion models to determine the toxic hazard distance for the toxic concentration threshold and proximity of a toxicant to populated areas. A launch operator, when employing this method, must proceed with a launch processing operation only if real-time modeling of the potential release demonstrates that the toxic hazard distance would not reach populated areas. The launch operator's process for carrying out this method must include the use of an air dispersion modeling technique that complies with paragraph (g) of this section and providing real-time meteorological data for the sphere of influence around a potential toxic release site as input to the air dispersion model. The launch operator's process must also include a review of the meteorological conditions to identify changing conditions that could affect the toxic hazard distance for a toxic concentration threshold prior to proceeding with the operation.

\(ii\) A launch operator may use air dispersion modeling techniques to define the meteorological conditions that, when present, would prevent a toxic hazard distance for a toxic concentration threshold from reaching populated areas. The launch operator, when employing this method, must constrain the associated launch processing operation to be conducted only when the prescribed meteorological conditions exist. A launch operator's air dispersion modeling technique must comply with paragraph (g) of this section.

\(l\) *Statistical toxic risk management for launch processing.* The launch operator must use statistical toxic risk management to protect public safety if a process that involves the use of a toxic propellant does not satisfy the containment requirements of paragraph (d) of this section. A launch operator, for each such case, must perform a toxic risk assessment and develop criteria that protect the public from risks due to planned and potential toxic release. A launch operator must ensure that the resultant toxic risk meets the collective and individual risk criteria requirements defined in [[Volume 4/C Licensing/0417 Launch safety.md#§417.107   Flight safety.|§417.107]](b). A launch operator's toxic risk assessment must account for the following:

\(1\) All credible equipment failure and non-failure modes, along with the consequent release and combustion of toxic propellants;

\(2\) Equipment failure rates;

\(3\) The effect of positive or negative buoyancy on the rise or descent of the released toxic propellants;

\(4\) The influence of atmospheric physics on the transport and diffusion of toxic propellants released;

\(5\) Meteorological conditions at the time of the process;

\(6\) Population density, location, susceptibility (health categories) and sheltering for populations within each potential toxic hazard area; and

\(7\) Exposure duration and toxic propellant concentration or dosage that would result in casualty for populations.

\(m\) *Launch processing toxic release hazard analysis products.* The products of a launch operator's toxic release hazards analysis for launch processing must include the following:

\(1\) For each worst-case release scenario, a description of the vessel or pipeline and toxic propellant selected as the worst case for each process, assumptions and parameters used, and the rationale for selection of that scenario. Assumptions must include use of administrative controls and passive mitigation that were assumed to limit the quantity that could be released. The description must include the anticipated effect of the controls and mitigation on the release quantity and rate;

\(2\) For each worst-case alternative release scenario, a description of the scenario identified for each process, assumptions and parameters used, and the rationale for the selection of that scenario. Assumptions must include use of administrative controls and passive mitigation that were assumed to limit the quantity that could be released. The description must include the anticipated effect of the controls and mitigation on the release quantity and rate;

\(3\) Estimated quantity released, release rate, and duration of release for each worst-case scenario and worst-case alternative scenario for each process;

\(4\) A description of the methodology used to determine the toxic hazard distance for each toxic concentration threshold;

\(5\) Data used to estimate off-site population receptors potentially affected; and

\(6\) The following data for each worst-case scenario and worst-case alternative release scenario:

\(i\) Chemical name;

\(ii\) Physical state;

\(iii\) Basis of results (provide model name if used, or other methodology);

\(iv\) Scenario (explosion, fire, toxic gas release, or liquid spill and vaporization);

\(v\) Quantity released in pounds;

\(vi\) Release rate;

\(vii\) Release duration;

\(viii\) Wind speed and atmospheric stability class;

\(ix\) Topography;

\(x\) Toxic hazard distance;

\(xi\) All members of the public within the toxic hazard distance;

\(xii\) Any passive mitigation considered; and

\(xiii\) Active mitigation considered (worst-case alternative release scenario only).
