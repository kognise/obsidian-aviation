## Subpart B—Minimum Requirements and Application Procedures

### §1300.10   General standards for Board issuance of Federal credit instruments.

\(a\) In accordance with section 102(c)(1) of the Act, the Board may enter into agreements with one or more borrowers to issue Federal credit instruments only if the Board determines, in its discretion and in accordance with the minimum requirements set forth in this part, that—

\(1\) The borrower is an air carrier for which credit is not reasonably available at the time of the transaction;

\(2\) The intended obligation by the borrower is prudently incurred; and

\(3\) Such agreement is a necessary part of maintaining a safe, efficient, and viable commercial aviation system in the United States.

\(b\) In accordance with section 102(c)(2)(A) of the Act, the Board shall enter into an agreement to issue a Federal credit instrument in such form and on such terms and conditions and subject to such covenants, representations, warranties, and requirements (including requirements for audits) as the Board determines are appropriate for satisfying the requirements of this part and any supplemental requirements issued by the Board under section 102(c)(2)(B) of the Act.

\(c\) In accordance with section 102(d)(1) of the Act, in entering into agreements to issue Federal credit instruments, the Board shall, to the extent feasible and practicable and in accordance with the requirements in this part, ensure that the Federal Government is compensated for the risk assumed in making guarantees.

\(d\) In accordance with Section 102(d)(2) of the Act, the Board is authorized to enter into contracts under which the Federal Government, contingent on the financial success of the air carrier, would participate in the gains of the air carrier or its security holders through the use of such instruments as warrants, stock options, common or preferred stock, or other appropriate equity instruments, except that the Board shall not accept an equity interest in an air carrier that gives the Federal Government voting rights.

\(e\) In accordance with Section 104(a) of the Act, the Board may only issue a Federal credit instrument to an air carrier after the air carrier enters into a legally binding agreement with the Board regarding certain employee compensation.

### §1300.11   Eligible borrower.

\(a\) An eligible borrower must be an air carrier that can demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Board, that:

\(1\) It has incurred (or is incurring) losses as a result of the terrorist attacks on the United States that occurred on September 11, 2001, which may include losses due to the unavailability of credit or the decrease in demand for that air carrier's services;

\(2\) It is not under bankruptcy protection or receivership when the application is submitted or when the Board issues the guarantee, unless the guarantee and the underlying financial obligation is to be part of a bankruptcy court-certified reorganization plan;

\(3\) It has agreed to permit such audits and reviews prior to the issuance of a guarantee, as the Board may deem appropriate, by an independent auditor acceptable to the Board;

\(4\) It has agreed to permit such audits and reviews during the period the loan is outstanding and three years after payment in full of the guaranteed loan, as the Board may deem appropriate, by an independent auditor acceptable to the Board or by the Comptroller General;

\(5\) In conducting audits and reviews pursuant to paragraphs (a) (3) and (4) of this section, it has agreed to provide access to the officers and employees, books, records, accounts, documents, correspondence, and other information of the borrower, its subsidiaries, affiliates, financial advisers, consultants, and independent certified accountants that the Board or the Comptroller General consider necessary.

\(b\) Status as an eligible borrower under this section does not ensure that the Board will issue the guarantee sought or preclude the Board from declining to issue a guarantee.

### §1300.12   Eligible lender.

\(a\) A lender eligible to receive a Federal credit instrument approved by the Board must be a non-Federal qualified institutional buyer as defined in Section 102(a)(3) of the Act.

\(b\) If more than one institution participates as a lender in a single loan for which a Federal credit instrument is requested, each one of the institutions on the application must meet the requirements to be an eligible lender. An application for a guarantee of a single loan, for which there is more than one lender, must identify one of the institutions to act as agent for all. This agent is responsible for administering the loan and shall have those duties and responsibilities required of an agent, as set forth in the guarantee.

\(c\) Each lender, irrespective of any indemnities or other agreements between the lenders and the agent, shall be bound by all actions, and/or failures to act, of the agent. The Board shall be entitled to rely upon such actions and/or failures to act of the agent as binding the lenders.

\(d\) Status as an eligible lender under this section does not assure that the Board will issue the guarantee sought, or otherwise preclude the Board from declining to issue a guarantee.

### §1300.13   Guarantee amount.

\(a\) Under Section 101(a)(1) of the Act, the Board is authorized to enter into agreements to issue Federal credit instruments that, in the aggregate, do not exceed \$10 billion.

\(b\) The loan amount guaranteed to a single air carrier may not exceed that amount that, in the Board's sole discretion, the air carrier (or its successor) needs in order for it to provide commercial air services.

### §1300.14   Guarantee percentage.

A guarantee issued by the Board must be less than 100 percent of the amount of principal and accrued interest of the loan guaranteed.

### §1300.15   Loan terms.

\(a\) A loan guaranteed under the program shall be due and payable in full no later than seven years from the date on which the first disbursement of the loan is made.

\(b\) Loans guaranteed under the program must bear a rate of interest determined by the Board to be reasonable. In determining the reasonableness of an interest rate, the Board shall consider the percentage of the guarantee, any collateral, other loan terms, and current average yields on outstanding obligations of the United States with maturity comparable to the term of the loan guaranteed. The Board may reject an application to guarantee a loan if it determines the interest rate on such loan to be unreasonable.

\(c\) An eligible lender may assess and collect from the borrower such other fees and costs associated with the application and origination of the loan as are reasonable and customary, taking into consideration the amount and complexity of the credit. The Board may take such other fees and costs into consideration when determining whether to offer a guarantee to the lender.

### §1300.16   Application process.

### §1300.17   Application evaluation.

\(a\) Eligibility screening. Applications will be reviewed to determine whether the lender and borrower are eligible, the information required under §1300.16(b) is complete, and the proposed loan complies with applicable statutes and regulations. The Board may at any time reject an application that does not meet these requirements.

\(2\) The adequacy of the proposed provisions to protect the Federal Government, including sufficiency of any security provided by the borrower and the percentage of guarantee requested;

\(4\) The ability of the borrower to demonstrate, to the Board's satisfaction, one or more of the following criteria. The Board shall give preference to applications that satisfy one or more of these criteria, giving greater preference to those applications that meet the greatest number of these criteria, as follows:

\(i\) A demonstration that the air carrier has presented a plan demonstrating that its business plan is financially sound;

\(ii\) A demonstration of greater participation in the loan by non-Federal entities;

\(iii\) A demonstration of greater participation in the loan by private entities, as opposed to public non-Federal entities;

\(iv\) A demonstration that the proposed instruments would ensure that the Federal Government will, contingent on the financial success of the air carrier, participate in the gains of the air carrier and its security holders;

\(vii\) A demonstration that the proposed instruments contain financial structures that minimize the Federal government's risk and cost associated with making loan guarantees. Examples include, but are not limited to, requests for guarantees that contain the following:

\(A\) A maturity period that is less than the maximum permitted under the rules in this part;

\(B\) Pledges of collateral;

\(2\) A negotiated repayment schedule is established; or

\(3\) Other arrangements, satisfactory to the agency responsible for collecting the debt are made.

\(d\) Decisions by the Board. The Board shall approve or deny applications received on or before June 28, 2002, in a timely manner as such applications are received. The Board may limit the amount of a loan guarantee made to initial applicants to ensure that sufficient funds remain available for subsequent applicants. The Board shall notify the borrower in writing of the approval or denial of an application. Approvals for loan guarantees shall be conditioned upon compliance with §1300.18.
