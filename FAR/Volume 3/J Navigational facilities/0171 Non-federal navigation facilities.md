*Course line* means the locus of points along the final approach course at which the DDM is zero.

*Course sector* means a sector in a horizontal plane containing the course line and limited by the loci of points nearest to the course line at which the DDM is 0.155.

*Displacement sensitivity* means the ratio of measured DDM to the corresponding lateral displacement from the appropriate reference line.

*Front course sector* means the course sector centered on the course line in the direction from the runway in which a normal final approach is made.

*Reference datum* means a point at a specified height located vertically above the intersection of the course and the threshold.

*Missed approach point* means the point on the final approach course, not farther from the final approach fix than Point “A2”, at which the approach must be abandoned, if the approach and subsequent landing cannot be safely completed by visual reference, whether or not the aircraft has descended to the minimum descent altitude.

### §171.109   Performance requirements.

\(a\) The Simplified Directional Facility must perform in accordance with the following standards and practices:

\(1\) The radiation from the SDF antenna system must produce a composite field pattern which is amplitude modulated by a 90 Hz and a 150 Hz tone. The radiation field pattern must produce a course sector with the 90 Hz tone predominating on one side of the course and with the 150 Hz tone predominating on the opposite side.

\(2\) When an observer faces the SDF from the approach end of runway, the depth of modulation of the radio frequency carrier due to the 150 Hz tone must predominate on his right hand and that due to the 90 Hz tone must predominate on his left hand.

\(3\) All horizontal angles employed in specifying the SDF field patterns must originate from the center of the antenna system which provides the signals used in the front course sector.

\(4\) The SDF must operate on odd tenths or odd tenths plus a twentieth MHz within the frequency band 108.1 MHz to 111.95 MHz. The frequency tolerance of the radio frequency carrier must not exceed plus or minus 0.002 percent.

\(5\) The radiated emission from the SDF must be horizontally polarized. The vertically polarized component of the radiation on the course line must not exceed that which corresponds to an error one-twentieth of the course sector width when an aircraft is positioned on the course line and is in a roll attitude of 20° from the horizontal.

\(6\) The SDF must provide signals sufficient to allow satisfactory operation of a typical aircraft installation within the sector which extends from the center of the SDF antenna system to distances of 18 nautical miles within a plus or minus 10° sector and 10 nautical miles within the remainder of the coverage when alternative navigational facilities provide satisfactory coverage within the intermediate approach area. SDF signals must be receivable at the distances specified at and above a height of 1,000 feet above the elevation of the threshold, or the lowest altitude authorized for transition, whichever is higher. Such signals must be receivable, to the distances specified, up to a surface extending outward from the SDF antenna and inclined at 7° above the horizontal.

\(7\) The modulation tones must be phase-locked so that within the half course sector, the demodulated 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave forms pass through zero in the same direction within 20° of phase relative to the 150 Hz component, every half cycle of the combined 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave form. However, the phase need not be measured within the half course sector.

\(8\) The angle of convergence of the final approach course and the extended runway centerline must not exceed 30°. The final approach course must be aligned to intersect the extended runway centerline between points A1 and the runway threshold. When an operational advantage can be achieved, a final approach course that does not intersect the runway or that intersects it at a distance greater than point A1 from the threshold, may be established, if that course lies within 500 feet laterally of the extended runway centerline at a point 3,000 feet outward from the runway threshold. The mean course line must be maintained within ±10 percent of the course sector width.

\(9\) The nominal displacement sensitivity within the half course sector must be 50 microamperes/degree. The nominal course sector width must be 6°. When an operational advantage can be achieved, a nominal displacement sensitivity of 25 microamperes/degree may be established, with a nominal course sector width of 12° with proportional displacement sensitivity. The lateral displacement sensitivity must be adjusted and maintained within the limits of plus or minus 17 percent of the nominal value.

\(10\) The off-course (clearance) signal must increase at a substantially linear rate with respect to the angular displacement from the course line up to an angle on either side of the course line where 175 microamperes of deflection is obtained. From that angle to ±10°, the off-course deflection must not be less than 175 microamperes. From ±10° to ±35° the off-course deflection must not be less than 150 microamperes. With the course adjusted to cause any of several monitor alarm conditions, the aforementioned values of 175 microamperes in the sector 10° each side of course and 150 microamperes in the sector ±10° to ±35° may be reduced to 160 microamperes and 135 microamperes, respectively. These conditions must be met at a distance of 18 nautical miles from the SDF antenna within the sector 10° each side of course line and 10 nautical miles from the SDF antenna within the sector ±10° to ±35° each side of course line.

\(11\) The SDF may provide a ground-to-air radiotelephone communication channel to be operated simultaneously with the navigation and identification signals, if that operation does not interfere with the basic function. If a channel is provided, it must conform with the following standards:

\(i\) The channel must be on the same radio frequency carrier or carriers as used for the SDF function, and the radiation must be horizontally polarized. Where two carriers are modulated with speech, the relative phases of the modulations on the two carriers must avoid the occurrence of nulls within the coverage of the SDF.

\(ii\) On centerline, the peak modulation depth of the carrier or carriers due to the radiotelephone communications must not exceed 50 percent but must be adjusted so that the ratio of peak modulation depth due to the radiotelephone communications to that due to the identification signal is approximately 9:1.

\(iii\) The audio frequency characteristics of the radiotelephone channel must be flat to within 3 db relative to the level at 1,000 Hz over the range from 300 Hz to 3,000 Hz.

(12)(i) The SDF must provide for the simultaneous transmission of an identification signal, specific to the runway and approach direction, on the same radio frequency carrier or carriers as used for the SDF function. The transmission of the identification signal must not interfere in any way with the basic SDF function.

\(ii\) The identification signal must be produced by Class A2 modulation of the radio frequency carrier or carriers using a modulation tone of 1020 Hz within ±50 Hz. The depth of modulation must be between the limits of 5 and 15 percent except that, where a radiotelephone communication channel is provided, the depth of modulation must be adjusted so that the ratio of peak modulation depth due to radiotelephone communications to that due to the identification signal modulation is approximately 9:1. The emissions carrying the identification signal must be horizontally polarized.

\(iii\) The identification signal must employ the International Morse Code and consist of three letters.

\(iv\) The identification signal must be transmitted at a speed corresponding to approximately seven words per minute, and must be repeated at approximately equal intervals, not less than six times per minute. When SDF transmission is not available for operational use, including periods of removal of navigational components or during maintenance or test transmissions, the identification signal must be suppressed.

\(b\) It must be shown during ground inspection of the design features of the equipment that there will not be conditions that will allow unsafe operations because of component failure or deterioration.

\(c\) The monitor must be checked periodically during the in-service test evaluation period for calibration and stability. These tests, and ground checks of SDF radiation characteristics must be conducted in accordance with the maintenance manual required by [[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.115   Maintenance and operations requirements.|§171.115]](c) and must meet the standards and tolerances contained in [[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.111   Ground standards and tolerances.|§171.111]](j).

\(d\) The monitor system must provide a warning to the designated control point(s) when any of the conditions of [[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.111   Ground standards and tolerances.|§171.111]](j) occur, within the time periods specified in that paragraph.

\(e\) Flight inspection to determine the adequacy of the facility's operational performance and compliance with applicable performance requirements must be conducted in accordance with the “U.S. Standard Flight Inspection Manual.” Tolerances contained in the U.S. Standard Flight Inspection Manual, section 217, must be complied with except as stated in paragraph (f) of this section.

\(f\) Flight inspection tolerances specified in section 217 of the “U.S. Standard Flight Inspection Manual” must be complied with except as follows:

\(1\) *Course sector width.* The nominal course sector width must be 6°. When an operational advantage can be achieved, a nominal course sector width of 12° may be established. Course sector width must be adjusted and maintained within the limits of ±17 percent of the nominal value.

\(2\) *Course alignment.* The mean course line must be adjusted and maintained within the limits of ±10 percent of the nominal course sector width.

\(2\) Guidance modulation must be impressed on the microwave carrier of the radiated signal in the form of a summation of 90 Hz and 150 Hz sinusoidal modulation corresponding to the pointing direction of the particular beam which radiates the signal.

\(3\) Each of the effective beam positions must be illuminated in a particular sequence for a short time interval. The modulation impressed on each beam must be a sample of the combined 90 Hz and 150 Hz waveform appropriate for that particular beam direction and time slot, and must be accomplished by appropriately varying the length of time the carrier is radiated during each beam illumination interval.

### §171.261   Localizer performance requirements.

This section prescribes the performance requirements for localizer equipment components of the ISMLS.

\(a\) The localizer antenna system must:

\(1\) Be located on the extension of the centerline of the runway at the stop end;

\(2\) Be adjusted so that the course line be on a vertical plane containing the centerline of the runway served;

\(3\) Have the minimum height necessary to comply with the coverage requirements prescribed in paragraph (j) of this section;

\(4\) Be located at a distance from the stop end of the runway that is consistent with safe obstruction clearance practices;

\(5\) Not obscure any light of the approach landing system; and

\(6\) Be installed on frangible mounts or beyond the 1000′ light bar.

\(b\) On runways where limited terrain prevents the localizer antennae from being positioned on the runway centerline extended, and the cost of the land fill or a tall tower antenna support is prohibitive, the localizer antenna array may be offset, including a collocated ground station, so that the course intercepts the centerline at a point determined by the amount of the angular offset and the glide path angle. If other than a runway centerline localizer is used, the criteria in subpart C of [[Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0097 Standard instrument procedures.md|part 97 of this chapter]] is applicable.

\(c\) At locations where two separate ISMLS facilities serve opposite ends of of a single runway, an interlock must ensure that only the facility serving the approach direction being used will radiate.

\(d\) The radiation from the localizer antenna system must produce a composite field pattern which is pulse duration modulated, the time average equivalent to amplitude modulation by a 90 Hz and 150 Hz tone. The localizer station must transmit angular guidance information over a C-band microwave carrier on narrow, scanned antenna beams that are encoded to produce a modulation in space which, after averaging over several beam scans, is equivalent to the modulation used for conventional ILS as specified in subpart C of this part. The radiation field pattern must produce a course sector with one tone predominating on one side of the course and with the other tone predominating on the opposite side. When an observer faces the localizer from the approach end of the runway, the depth of modulation of the radio frequency carrier due to the 150 Hz tone must predominate on his right hand and that due to the 90 Hz tone must predominate on his left hand.

\(e\) All horizontal angles employed in specifying the localizer field patterns must originate from the center of the localizer antenna system which provides the signals used in the front course sector.

\(f\) The ISMLS course sector angle must be adjustable between 3 degrees and 9 degrees. The applicable course sector angle will be established and approved on an individual basis.

\(g\) The ISMLS localizer must operate in the band 5000 MHz to 5030 MHz. The frequency tolerance may not exceed ±0.0001 percent.

\(h\) The emission from the localizer must be vertically polarized. The horizontally polarized component of the radiation of the course line may not exceed that which corresponds to a DDM error of 0.016 when an aircraft is positioned on the course line and is in a roll attitude of 20 degrees from the horizontal.

\(i\) The localizer must provide signals sufficient to allow satisfactory operation of a typical aircraft installation within the localizer and glide path coverage sectors. The localizer coverage sector must extend from the center of the localizer antenna system to distances of 18 nautical miles minimum within ±10 degrees from the front course line, and 10 nautical miles minimum between ±10 degrees and ±35 degrees from the front course line. The ISMLS localizer signals must be receivable at the distances specified up from a surface extending outward from the localizer antenna and within a sector in the elevation plane from 0.300 to 1.750 of the established glide path angle (θ).

\(j\) Except as provided in paragraph (k) of this section, in all parts of the coverage volume specified in paragraph (i) of this section, the peak field strength may not be less than −87 dBW/m2, and must permit satisfactory operational usage of ISMLS localizer facilities.

\(k\) The minimum peak field strength on the ISMLS glide path and within the localizer course sector from a distance of 10 nautical miles to a height of 100 feet (30 meters) above the horizontal plane containing the threshold, may not be less than + 87 dBW/m2.

\(l\) Above 16 degrees, the ISMLS localizer signals must be reduced to as low a value as practicable.

\(m\) Bends in the course line may not have amplitudes which exceed the following:

</div>

</div>

\(n\) The amplitudes referred to in paragraph (m) of this section are the DDMs due to bends as realized on the mean course line, when correctly adjusted.

\(o\) The radio frequency carrier must meet the following requirements:

\(1\) The nominal depth of modulation of the radio frequency carrier due to each of the 90 Hz and 150 Hz tones must be 20 percent along the course line.

\(2\) The depth of modulation of the radio frequency carrier due to each of the 90 Hz and 150 Hz tones must be between 18 and 22 percent.

\(4\) Total harmonic content of the 90 Hz tone may not exceed 10 percent.

\(5\) Total harmonic content of the 150 Hz tone may not exceed 10 percent. However, a 300 Hz tone may be transmitted for identification purposes.

\(6\) At every half cycle of the combined 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave form, the modulation tones must be phase-locked so that within the half course sector, the demodulated 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave forms pass through zero in the same direction within 20 degrees with phase relative to the 150 Hz component. However, the phase need not be measured within the half course sector.

\(p\) The mean course line must be adjusted and maintained within ±.015DDM from the runway centerline at the ISMLS reference datum.

\(q\) The nominal displacement sensitivity within the half course sector at the ISMLS reference datum, must be 0.00145 DDM/meter (0.00044DDM/foot). However, where the specified nominal displacement sensitivity cannot be met, the displacement sensitivity must be adjusted as near as possible to that value.

\(r\) The lateral displacement sensitivity must be adjusted and maintained within 17 percent of the nominal value. Nominal sector width at the ISMLS reference datum is 210 meters (700 feet).

\(s\) The increase of DDM must be substantially linear with respect to angular displacement from the front course line where DDM is zero, up to angle on either side of the front course line where the DDM is 0.180. From that angle to ±10 degrees, the DDM may not be less than 0.180. From ±10 degrees to ±35 degrees, the DDM may not be less than 0.155.

\(t\) The localizer must provide for the simultaneous transmission of an identification signal which meets the following:

\(1\) It must be specific to the runway and approach direction, on the same radio frequency carrier, as used for the localizer function.

\(2\) Transmission of the identification signal may not interfere in any way with the basic localizer function.

\(3\) The signal must be produced by pulse duration modulation of the radio frequency carrier resulting in a detected audio tone in the airborne VHF receiver of 1020 Hz ±50Hz.

\(4\) The depth of modulation must be between the limits of 10 and 12 percent.

\(5\) The emissions carrying the identification signal must be vertically polarized.

\(6\) The identification signal must employ the International Morse Code and consist of three letters. It must be preceded by the International Morse Code signal of the letter “M” followed by a short pause where it is necessary to distinguish the ISMLS facility from other navigational facilities in the immediate area. At airports where both an ISMLS and an ILS are in operation, each facility must have a different identification call sign.

\(7\) The signal must be transmitted at a speed corresponding to approximately seven words per minute, and must be repeated at approximately equal intervals, not less than six times per minute, during which time the localizer is available for operational use. When the localizer is not available for transmission, the identification signal must be suppressed.

### §171.263   Localizer automatic monitor system.

\(a\) The ISMLS localizer equipment must provide an automatic monitor system that transmits a warning to designated local and remote control points when any of the following occurs:

\(1\) A shift of the mean course line of the localizer from the runway centerline equivalent to more than 0.015 DDM at the ISMLS reference datum.

\(2\) For localizers in which the basic functions are provided by the use of a single-frequency system, a reduction of power output to less than 50 percent of normal or a loss of ground station identification transmissions.

\(3\) Changes of displacement sensitivity to a value differing by more than 17 percent from nominal value for the localizer.

\(4\) Failure of any part of the monitor itself. Such failure must automatically produce the same results as the malfunctioning of the element being monitored.

\(b\) Within 10 seconds of the occurrence of any of the conditions prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section, including periods of zero radiation, localizer signal radiation must cease or the navigation and identification components must be removed.

### §171.265   Glide path performance requirements.

This section prescribes the performance requirements for glide path equipment components of the ISMLS. These requirements are based on the assumption that the aircraft is heading directly toward the facility.

\(a\) The glide slope antenna system must be located near the approach end of the runway, and the equipment must be adjusted so that the vertical path line will be in a sloping horizontal plane containing the centerline of the runway being served, and satisfy the coverage requirements prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section. For the purpose of obstacle clearance, location of the glide slope antenna system must be in accordance with the criteria specified in subpart C of [[Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0097 Standard instrument procedures.md|part 97 of this chapter]].

\(b\) The radiation from the glide path antenna system must produce a composite field pattern which is pulse duration modulated by a 90 Hz and a 150 Hz tone, which is the time average equivalent to amplitude modulation. The pattern must be arranged to provide a straight line descent path in the vertical plane containing the centerline of the runway, with the 150 Hz tone predominating below the path and the 90 Hz tone predominating above the path to at least an angle equal to 1.752θ. As used in this section theta (θ), denotes the nominal glide path angle. The glide path angle must be adjusted and maintained within 0.075θ.

\(c\) The glide path equipment must be capable of producing a radiated glide path from 3 to 9 degrees with respect to the horizontal. However, ISMLS glide path angles in excess of 3 degrees may be used to satisfy instrument approach procedures or to overcome an obstruction clearance problem, only in accordance with the criteria specified in subpart C of [[Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0097 Standard instrument procedures.md|part 97 of this chapter]].

\(d\) The downward extended straight portion of the ISMLS glide path must pass through the ISMLS reference datum at a height ensuring safe guidance over obstructions and safe and efficient use of the runway served. The height of the ISMLS reference datum must be in accordance with subpart C of [[Volume 2/F Air traffic and general operating rules/0097 Standard instrument procedures.md|part 97 of this chapter]].

\(e\) The glide path equipment must operate in the band 5220 MHz to 5250 MHz. The frequency tolerance may not exceed ±0.0001 percent.

\(f\) The emission from the glide path equipment must be vertically polarized.

\(g\) The glide path equipment must provide signals sufficient to allow satisfactory operation of a typical aircraft installation insectors of 8 degrees on each side of the centerline of the ISMLS glide path, to a distance of at least 10 nautical miles up to 1.75θ and down to 0.45θ above the horizontal or to such lower angle at which 0.22 DDM is realized.

\(h\) To provide the coverage for glide path performance specified in paragraph (g) of this section, the minimum peak field strength within this coverage sector must be −82 dBW/m2. The peak field strength must be provided on the glide path down to a height of 30 meters (100 feet) above the horizontal plane containing the threshold.

\(i\) Bends in the glide path may not have amplitudes which exceed the following:

<div>

<div>

<table data-border="1" data-cellpadding="1" data-cellspacing="1" data-frame="void" width="100%"><tbody><tr class="header"><th scope="col">Zone</th><th scope="col">Amplitude (DDM) (95 pct. probability)</th></tr><tr class="odd"><td style="text-align: left;" scope="row">Outer limit of coverage to ISMLS point “C.”</td><td style="text-align: right;">0.035.</td></tr></tbody></table>

</div>

</div>

\(j\) Guidance modulation must be impressed on the microwave carrier of the radiated glide slope signal in the form of a unique summation of 90 Hz and 150 Hz sinusoidal modulation corresponding to the point direction of the particular beam which radiates the signal. Each of the effective beam positions must be illuminated in sequence for a short time interval. The scan rate must be synchronous with the 90 and 150 Hz tone base. The modulation impressed on each beam must be a sample of the combined 90 Hz and 150 Hz waveform appropriate for that particular beam direction and time slot. The actual modulation must be accomplished by appropriately varying the length of time the carrier is radiated during each beam illumination interval.

\(k\) The nominal depth of modulation of the radio frequency carrier due to each of the 90 Hz and 150 Hz tones must be 40 percent along the ISMLS glide path. The depth of modulation may not deviate outside the limits of 37.5 percent to 42.5 percent.

\(l\) The following tolerances apply to the frequencies of the modulating tones:

\(1\) The modulating tones must be 90 Hz and 150 Hz within 2.5 percent.

\(2\) The total harmonic content of the 90 Hz tone may not exceed 10 percent.

\(3\) The total harmonic content of the 150 Hz tone may not exceed 10 percent.

\(m\) At every half cycle of the combined 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave form, the modulation must be phase-locked so that, within the ISMLS half glide path sector, the demodulated 90 Hz and 150 Hz wave forms pass through zero in the same direction within 20 degrees of phase relative to the 150 Hz component. However, the phase need not be measured within the ISMLS half glide path sector.

\(n\) The nominal angular displacement sensitivity must correspond to a DDM of 0.0875 at an angular displacement above and below the glide path of 0.12θ. The glide path angular displacement sensitivity must be adjusted and maintained within ±25 percent of the nominal value selected. The upper and lower sectors must be as symmetrical as practicable within the limits prescribed in this paragraph.

\(o\) The DDM below the ISMLS glide path must increase smoothly for decreasing angle until a value of 0.22 DDM is reached. This value must be achieved at an angle not less than 0.30θ above the horizontal. However, if it is achieved at an angle above 0.45θ, the DDM value may not be less than 0.22 at least down to an angle of 0.45θ.

### §171.267   Glide path automatic monitor system.

\(a\) The ISMLS glide path equipment must provide an automatic monitor system that transmits a warning to designated local and remote control points when any of the following occurs:

\(1\) A shift of the mean ISMLS glide path angle equivalent to more than 0.075θ.

\(2\) For glide paths in which the basic functions are provided by the use of a single frequency system, a reduction of power output to less than 50 percent.

\(3\) A change of the angle between the glide path and the line below the glide path (150 Hz predominating), at which a DDM of 0.0875 is realized by more than ±0.0375θ.

## Subpart J—Microwave Landing System (MLS)

### §171.301   Scope.

This subpart sets forth minimum requirements for the approval, installation, operation and maintenance of non-Federal Microwave Landing System (MLS) facilities that provide the basis for instrument flight rules (IFR) and air traffic control procedures.

### §171.303   Definitions.

As used in this subpart:

*Auxiliary data* means data transmitted in addition to basic data that provide ground equipment siting information for use in refining airborne position calculations and other supplementary information.

*Basic data* means data transmitted by the ground equipment that are associated directly with the operation of the landing guidance system.

*Beam center* means the midpoint between the −3 dB points on the leading and trailing edges of the scanning beam main lobe.

*Beamwidth* means the width of the scanning beam main lobe measured at the −3 dB points and defined in angular units on the boresight, in the horizontal plane for the azimuth function and in the vertical plane for the elevation function.

*Clearance guidance sector* means the volume of airspace, inside the coverage sector, within which the azimuth guidance information provided is not proportional to the angular displacement of the aircraft, but is a constant fly-left or fly-right indication of the direction relative to the approach course the aircraft should proceed in order to enter the proportional guidance sector.

*Control Motion Noise (CMN)* means those fluctuations in the guidance which affect aircraft attitude, control surface motion, column motion, and wheel motion. Control motion noise is evaluated by filtering the flight error record with a band-pass filter which has corner frequencies at 0.3 radian/sec and 10 radians/sec for azimuth data and 0.5 radian/sec and 10 radians/sec for elevation data.

*Data rate* means the average number of times per second that transmissions occur for a given function.

*Differential Phase Shift Keying (DPSK)* means differential phase modulation of the radio frequency carrier with relative phase states of 0 degree or 180 degrees.

*Failure* means the inability of an item to perform within previously specified limits.

*Guard time* means an unused period of time provided in the transmitted signal format to allow for equipment tolerances.

*Integrity* means that quality which relates to the trust which can be placed in the correctness of the information supplied by the facility.

*Mean corrective time* means the average time required to correct an equipment failure over a given period, after a service technician reaches the facility.

*Mean course error* means the mean value of the azimuth error along a specified radial of the azimuth function.

*Mean glide path error* means the mean value of the elevation error along a specified glidepath of the elevation function.

*Mean-time-between-failures (MTBF)* means the average time between equipment failures over a given period.

*Microwave Landing System (MLS)* means the MLS selected by ICAO for international standardization.

*Minimum glidepath* means the lowest angle of descent along the zero degree azimuth that is consistent with published approach procedures and obstacle clearance criteria.

*MLS Approach Reference Datum* is a point at a specified height located vertically above the intersection of the runway centerline and the threshold.

*MLS back azimuth reference datum* means a point 15 meters (50 feet) above the runway centerline at the runway midpoint.

*MLS datum point* means a point defined by the intersection of the runway centerline with a vertical plane perpendicular to the centerline and passing through the elevation antenna phase center.

*Out of coverage indication (OCI)* means a signal radiated into areas outside the intended coverage sector, where required, to specifically prevent invalid removal of an airborne warning indication in the presence of misleading guidance information.

*Path Following Error (PFE)* means the guidance perturbations which could cause aircraft displacement from the desired course or glidepath. It is composed of the path following noise and of the mean course error in the case of azimuth functions, or the mean glidepath error in the case of elevation functions. Path following errors are evaluated by filtering the flight error record with a second order low pass filter which has a corner frequency at 0.5 radian/sec for azimuth data or 1.5 radians/sec for elevation data.

*Path following noise (PFN)* means that portion of the guidance signal error which could cause displacement from the actual mean course line or mean glidepath as appropriate.

*Split-site ground station* means the type of ground station in which the azimuth portion of the ground station is located near the stop end of the runway, and the elevation portion is located near the approach end.

*Time division multiplex (TDM)* means that each function is transmitted on the same frequency in time sequence, with a distinct preamble preceding each function transmission.

\(ii\) *Sector signals.* In all azimuth formats, sector signals must be transmitted to provide Morse Code identification, airborne antenna selection, and system test signals. These signals are not required in the elevation formats. In addition, if the signal from an installed ground component results in a valid indication in an area where no valid guidance should exist, OCI signals must be radiated as provided for in the signal format (see Tables 4a, 4b, and 5). The sector signals are defined as follows:

\(A\) *Morse Code.* DPSK transmissions that will permit Morse Code facility identification in the aircraft by a four letter code starting with the letter “M” must be included in all azimuth functions. They must be transmitted and repeated at approximately equal intervals, not less than six times per minute, during which time the ground subsystem is available for operational use. When the transmissions of the ground subsystem are not available, the identification signal must be suppressed. The audible tone in the aircraft is started by setting the Morse Code bit to logic “1” and stopped by a logic “0” (see Tables 4a and 4b). The identification code characteristics must conform to the following: the dot must be between 0.13 and 0.16 second in duration, and the dash between 0.39 and 0.48 second. The duration between dots and/or dashes must be one dot plus or minus 10%. The duration between characters (letters) must not be less than three dots. When back azimuth is provided, the code shall be transmitted by the approach azimuth and back azimuth within plus or minus 0.08 seconds.

\(B\) *Airborne antenna selection.* A signal for airborne antenna selection shall be transmitted as a “zero” DPSK signal lasting for a six-bit period (see Tables 4a and 4b).

<sup>1</sup>The actual commencement and completion of the TO and FRO scan transmissions are dependent upon the amount of proportional guidance provided. The time slots provided will accommodate a maximum scan of −1.5 degrees to + 29.5 degrees. Scan timing shall be compatible with accuracy requirements.

</div>

</div>

The duration of each pulse measured at the half amplitude point shall be at least 100 microseconds, and the rise and fall times shall be less then 10 microseconds. It shall be permissible to sequentially transmit two pulses in each out-of-coverage indication time slot. Where pulse pairs are used, the duration of each pulse shall be at least 50 microseconds, and the rise and fall times shall be less then 10 microseconds. The transmission of out-of-coverage indication pulses radiated from antennas with overlapping coverage patterns shall be separated by at least 10 microseconds.

<div>

Note: If desired, two pulses may be sequentially transmitted in each OCI time slot. Where pulse pairs are used, the duration of each pulse must be 45 (±5) microseconds and the rise and fall times must be less than 10 microseconds.

</div>

\(D\) *System test.* Time slots are provided in Tables 4a and 4b to allow radiation of TO and FRO test pulses. However, radiation of these pulses is not required since the characteristics of these pulses have not yet been standardized.

\(iii\) *Angle encoding.* The encoding must be as follows:

\(A\) *General.* Azimuth and elevation angles are encoded by scanning a narrow beam between the limits of the proportional coverage sector first in one direction (the TO scan) and then in the opposite direction (the FRO scan). Angular information must be encoded by the amount of time separation between the beam centers of the TO and FRO scanning beam pulses. The TO and FRO transmissions must be symmetrically disposed about the midscan point listed in Tables 4a, 4b, 5, and 7. The midscan point and the center of the time interval between the TO and FRO scan transmissions must coincide with a tolerance of ±10 microseconds. Angular coding must be linear with angle and properly decoded using the formula:

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/ec15se91.012.pdf)

\(B\) *Azimuth angle encoding.* Each guidance angle transmitted must consist of a clockwise TO scan followed by a counterclockwise FRO scan as viewed from above the antenna. For approach azimuth functions, increasing angle values must be in the direction of the TO scan; for the back azimuth function, increasing angle values must be in the direction of the FRO scan. The antenna has a narrow beam in the plane of the scan direction and a broad beam in the orthogonal plane which fills the vertical coverage.

\(C\) *Elevation angle encoding.* The radiation from elevation equipment must produce a beam which scans from the horizon up to the highest elevation angle and then scans back down to the horizon. The antenna has a narrow beam in the plane of the scan direction and a broad beam in the orthogonal plane which fills the horizontal coverage. Elevation angles are defined from the horizontal plane containing the antenna phase center; positive angles are above the horizontal and zero angle is along the horizontal.

\(iv\) *Clearance guidance.* The timing of the clearance pulses must be in accordance with Figure 8. For azimuth elements with proportional coverage of less than ±40 degrees (±20 degrees for back azimuth), clearance guidance information must be provided by transmitting pulses in a TO and FRO format adjacent to the stop/start times of the scanning beam signal. The fly-right clearance pulses must represent positive angles and the fly-left clearance pulses must represent negative angles. The duration of each clearance pulse must be 50 microseconds with a tolerance of ±5 microseconds. The transmitter switching time between the clearance pulses and the scanning beam transmissions must not exceed 10 microseconds. The rise time at the edge of each clearance pulse must be less than 10 microseconds. Within the fly-right clearance guidance section, the fly-right clearance guidance signal shall exceed scanning beam antenna sidelobes and other guidance and OCI signals by at least 5 dB; within the fly-left clearance guidance sector, the fly left clearance guidance signal shall exceed scanning beam antenna sidelobes and all other guidance and OCI signals by at least 5 dB; within the proportional guidance sector, the clearance guidance signals shall be at least 5dB below the proportional guidance signal. Optionally, clearance guidance may be provided by scanning throughout the approach guidance sector. For angles outside the approach azimuth proportional coverage limits as set in Basic Data Word One (Basic Data Word 5 for back azimuth), proper decode and display of clearance guidance must occur to the limits of the guidance region. Where used, clearance pulses shall be transmitted adjacent to the scanning beam signals at the edges of proportional coverage as shown in Figure 8. The proportional coverage boundary shall be established at one beamwidth inside the scan start/stop angles, such that the transition between scanning beam and clearance signals occurs outside the proportional coverage sector. When clearance pulses are provided in conjunction with a narrow beamwidth (e.g., one degree) scanning antenna, the scanning beam antenna shall radiate for 15 microseconds while stationary at the scan start/stop angles.

\(3\) *Data function format.* Basic data words provide equipment characteristics and certain siting information. Basic data words must be transmitted from an antenna located at the approach azimuth or back azimuth site which provides coverage throughout the appropriate sector. Data function timing must be in accordance with Table 7a.

\(i\) *Preamble.* Must be in accordance with requirements of [[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.311   Signal format requirements.|§171.311]](i)(1).

\(ii\) *Data transmissions.* Basic data must be transmitted using DPSK modulation. The content and repetition rate of each basic data word must be in accordance with Table 8a. For data containing digital information, binary number 1 must represent the lower range limit with increments in binary steps to the upper range limit shown in Table 8a. Data containing digital information shall be transmitted with the least significant bit first.

\(j\) *Basic Data word requirements.* Basic Data shall consist of the items specified in Table 8a. Basic Data word contents shall be defined as follows:

\(1\) *Approach azimuth to threshold distance* shall represent the minimum distance between the Approach Azimuth antenna phase center and the vertical plane perpendicular to the centerline which contains the landing threshold.

\(2\) *Approach azimuth proportional coverage limit* shall represent the limit of the sector in which proportional approach azimuth guidance is transmitted.

\(3\) *Clearance signal type* shall represent the type of clearance when used. Pulse clearance is that which is in accordance with [[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.311   Signal format requirements.|§171.311]] (i) (2) (iv). Scanning Beam (SB) clearance indicates that the proportional guidance sector is limited by the proportional coverage limits set in basic data.

The minimum proportional guidance sector must be plus or minus 10 degrees about the runway centerline. Clearance signals must be used to provide the balance of the required coverage, where the proportional sector is less than plus or minus 40 degrees.

\(iii\) Where intervening obstacles penetrate the lower surface, coverage need be provided only to the minimum line of sight.

\(3\) Runway region:

\(i\) Proportional guidance horizontally within a sector 45 meters (150 feet) each side of the runway centerline beginning at the stop end and extending parallel with the runway centerline in the direction of the approach to join the approach region.

\(2\) Be adjusted so that the zero degree azimuth plane will be a vertical plane which contains the centerline of the runway served;

\(3\) Have the minimum height necessary to comply with the coverage requirements prescribed in paragraph (a) of this section;

\(4\) Be located at a distance from the stop end of the runway that is consistent with safe obstruction clearance practices;

\(5\) Not obscure any light of an approach lighting system; and

\(6\) Be installed on frangible mounts or beyond the 300 meter (1,000 feet) light bar.

\(c\) On runways where limited terrain prevents the azimuth antenna from being positioned on the runway centerline extended, and the cost of the land fill or a tall tower antenna support is prohibitive, the azimuth antenna may be offset.

\(d\) *Antenna coordinates.* The scanning beams transmitted by the approach azimuth equipment within ±40° of the centerline may be either conical or planar.

\(e\) *Approach azimuth accuracy.* (1) The system and subsystem errors shall not exceed those listed in Table 10 at the approach reference datum.

At the approach reference datum, temporal sinusoidal noise components shall not exceed 0.025 degree peak in the frequency band 0.01 Hz to 1.6 Hz, and the CMN shall not exceed 0.10 degree. From the approach reference datum to the coverage limit, the PFE, PFN and CMN limits, expressed in angular terms, shall be allowed to linearly increase as follows:

\(i\) With distance along the runway centerline extended, by a factor of 1.2 for the PFE and PFN limits and to ±0.10 degree for the CMN limits.

\(ii\) With azimuth angle, by a factor of 1.5 at the ±40 degree and a factor of 2.0 at the ±60 degree azimuth angles for the PFE, PFN and CMN limits.

\(iii\) With elevation angle from + 9 degrees to + 15 degrees, by a factor of 1.5 for the PFE and PFN limits.

\(iv\) Maximum angular limits. The PFE limits shall not exceed ±0.25 degree in any coverage region below an elevation angle of + 9 degrees nor exceed ±0.50 degree in any coverage region above that elevation angle. The CMN limits shall not exceed ±0.10 degree in any coverage region within ±10 degrees of runway centerline extended nor exceed ±0.20 degree in any other region within coverage.

<div>

Note: It is desirable that the CMN not exceed ±0.10 degree throughout the coverage.

\(f\) Approach azimuth antenna characteristics are as follows:

\(1\) *Drift.* Any azimuth angle as encoded by the scanning beam at any point within the proportional coverage must not vary more than ±0.07 degree over the range of service conditions specified in [[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.309   General requirements.|§171.309]](d) without the use of internal environmental controls. Multipath effects are excluded from this requirement.

\(2\) *Beam pointing errors.* The azimuth angle as encoded by the scanning beam at any point within ±0.5 degree of the zero degree azimuth must not deviate from the true azimuth angle at that point by more than ±.05 degree. Multipath and drift effects are excluded from this requirement.

\(3\) *Antenna alignment.* The antenna must be equipped with suitable optical, electrical or mechanical means or any combination of the three, to bring the zero degree azimuth radial into coincidence with the approach reference datum (for centerline siting) with a maximum error of 0.02 degree. Additionally, the azimuth antenna bias adjustment must be electronically steerable at least to the monitor limits in steps not greater than 0.005 degree.

\(4\) *Antenna far field patterns in the plane of scan.* On boresight, the azimuth antenna mainlobe pattern must conform to Figure 10, and the beamwidth must be such that, in the installed environment, no significant lateral reflections of the mainlobe exist along the approach course. In any case the beamwidth must not exceed three degrees. Anywhere within coverage the −3 dB width of the antenna mainlobe, while scanning normally, must not be less than 25 microseconds (0.5 degree) or greater than 250 microseconds (5 degrees). The antenna mainlobe may be allowed to broaden from the value at boresight by a factor of 1/cosθ, where θ is the angle off boresight. The sidelobe levels must be as follows:

\(i\) *Dynamic sidelobe levels.* With the antenna scanning normally, the dynamic sidelobe level that is detected by a receiver at any point within the proportional coverage sector must be down at least 10 dB from the peak of the main beam. Outside the coverage sector, the radiation from the scanning beam antenna must be of such a nature that receiver warning will not be removed or suitable OCI signals must be provided.

\(ii\) *Effective sidelobe levels.* With the antenna scanning normally, the sidelobe levels in the plane of scan must be such that, in the installed environment, the CMN contributed by sidelobe reflections will not exceed the angular equivalent of 9 feet at approach reference datum over the required range of aircraft approach speeds.

\(5\) *Antenna far field pattern in the vertical plane.* The azimuth antenna free space radiation pattern below the horizon must have a slope of at least −8 dB/degree at the horizon and all sidelobes below the horizon must be at least 13 dB below the pattern peak. The antenna radiation pattern above the horizon must satisfy both the system coverage requirements and the spurious radiation requirement.

\(6\) *Data antenna.* The data antenna must have horizontal and vertical patterns as required for its function.

\(g\) *Back azimuth coverage requirements.* The back azimuth equipment where used must provide guidance information in at least the following volume of space (see Figure 11):

The minimum proportional guidance sector must be ±10 degrees about the runway centerline. Clearance signals must be used to provide the balance of the required coverage where the proportional sector is less than ±40 degrees.

\(2\) Vertically in the runway region between:

\(i\) A horizontal surface 2.5 meters (8 feet) above the farthest point of runway centerline which is in line of sight of the azimuth antenna, and,

\(ii\) A conical surface originating at the azimuth ground equipment antenna inclined at 20 degrees above the horizontal up to a height of 600 meters (2000 feet).

\(3\) Vertically in the back azimuth region between:

\(i\) A conical surface originating 2.5 meters (8 feet) above the runway stop end, included at 0.9 degree above the horizontal, and,

\(iii\) Where obstacles penetrate the lower coverage limits, coverage need be provided only to minimum line of sight.

\(4\) Within the back azimuth coverage sector defined in paragraph (q) (1), (2), and (3) of this section the power densities must not be less than those shown in Table 9, but the equipment design must also allow for:

\(i\) Transmitter power degradation from normal −1.5 dB.

\(ii\) Rain loss of −2.2 dB at the longitudinal coverage extremes.

\(h\) *Back azimuth siting.* The back azimuth equipment antenna must:

\(1\) Normally be located on the extension of the runway centerline at the threshold end;

\(2\) Be adjusted so that the vertical plane containing the zero degree course line contains the back azimuth reference datum;

\(3\) Have minimum height necessary to comply with the course requirements prescribed in paragraph (g) of this section;

\(4\) Be located at a distance from the threshold end that is consistent with safe obstruction clearance practices;

\(5\) Not obscure any light of an approach lighting system; and

\(6\) Be installed on frangible mounts or beyond the 300 meter (1000 feet) light bar.

\(i\) *Back azimuth antenna coordinates.* The scanning beams transmitted by the back azimuth equipment may be either conical or planar.

\(j\) *Back azimuth accuracy.* The requirements specified in [[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.313   Azimuth performance requirements.|§171.313]](e) apply except that the reference point is the back azimuth reference datum.

\(m\) *False guidance.* False courses which can be acquired and tracked by an aircraft shall not exist anywhere either inside or outside of the MLS coverage sector. False courses which exist outside of the minimum coverage sector may be suppressed by the use of OCI.

<div>

Note: False courses may be due to (but not limited to) MLS airborne receiver acquisition of the following types of false guidance: reflections of the scanning beam, scanning beam antenna sidelobes and grating lobes, and incorrect clearance.

</div>

### §171.315   Azimuth monitor system requirements.

\(a\) The approach azimuth or back azimuth monitor system must cause the radiation to cease and a warning must be provided at the designated control point if any of the following conditions persist for longer than the periods specified:

\(1\) There is a change in the ground equipment contribution to the mean course error component such that the path following error at the reference datum or in the direction of any azimuth radial, exceeds the limits specified in §[[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.313   Azimuth performance requirements.|§171.313]](e)(1) or 171.313(j) for a period of more than one second.

<div>

Note: The above requirement and the requirement to limit the ground equipment mean error to ±10 ft. can be satisfied by the following procedure. The integral monitor alarm limit should be set to the angular equivalent of ±10 ft. at the approach reference datum. This will limit the electrical component of the mean course error to ±10 ft. The field monitor alarm limit should be set such that with the mean course error at the alarm limit the total allowed PFE is not exceeded on any commissioned approach course from the limit of coverage to an altitude of 100 feet.

</div>

\(2\) There are errors in two consecutive transmissions of Basic Data Words 1, 2, 4 or 5.

\(3\) There is a reduction in the radiated power to a level not less than that specified in §[[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.313   Azimuth performance requirements.|§171.313]](a)(4) or 171.313(g)(4) for a period of more than one second.

\(4\) There is an error in the preamble DPSK transmissions which occurs more than once in any one second period.

\(5\) There is an error in the time division multiplex synchronization of a particular azimuth function that the requirement specified in [[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.311   Signal format requirements.|§171.311]](e) is not satisfied and if this condition persists for more than one second.

\(6\) A failure of the monitor is detected.

\(b\) Radiation of the following fuctions must cease and a warning provided at the designated control point if there are errors in 2 consecutive transmissions:

\(1\) Morse Code Identification,

\(2\) Basic Data Words 3 and 6,

\(3\) Auxiliary Data Words.

\(c\) The period during which erroneous guidance information is radiated must not exceed the periods specified in [[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.315   Azimuth monitor system requirements.|§171.315]](a). If the fault is not cleared within the time allowed, the ground equipment must be shut down. After shutdown, no attempt must be made to restore service until a period of 20 seconds has elapsed.

### §171.317   Approach elevation performance requirements.

This section prescribes the performance requirements for the elevation equipment components of the MLS as follows:

\(a\) *Elevation coverage requirements.* The approach elevation facility must provide proportional guidance information in at least the following volume of space (see Figure 13):

\(1\) Laterally within a sector originating at the datum point which is at least equal to the proportional guidance sector provided by the approach azimuth ground equipment.

\(2\) Longitudinally from 75 meters (250 feet) from the datum point to 20 nautical miles from threshold in the direction of the approach.

\(3\) Vertically within the sector bounded by:

\(i\) A surface which is the locus of points 2.5 meters (8 feet) above the runway surface;

\(ii\) A conical surface originating at the datum point and inclined 0.9 degree above the horizontal and,

\(iii\) A conical surface originating at the datum point and inclined at 15.0 degrees above the horizontal up to a height of 6000 meters (20,000 feet).

[View or download PDF](https://www.ecfr.gov/graphics/pdfs/ec15se91.020.pdf)

\(4\) Within the elevation coverage sector defined in paragraphs (a) (1), (2) and (3) of this section, the power densities must not be less than those shown in Table 9, but the equipment design must also allow for:

\(i\) Transmitter power degradation from normal by −1.5 dB.

\(ii\) Rain loss of −2.2 dB at the coverage extremes.

\(b\) *Elevation siting requirements.* The Elevation Antenna System must:

\(1\) Be located as close to runway centerline as possible (without violating obstacle clearance criteria).

\(2\) Be located near runway threshold such that the asymptote of the minimum glidepath crosses the threshold of the runway at the Approach Reference Datum height. Normally, the minimum glidepath should be 3 degrees and the Approach Reference Datum height should be 50 feet. However, there are circumstances where other glideslopes and reference datum heights are appropriate. Some of these instances are discussed in FAA Order 8260.34 (Glide Slope Threshold Crossing Height Requirements) and Order 8260.3 (IFR Approval of MLS.)

\(3\) Be located such that the MLS Approach Reference Datum and ILS Reference Datum heights are coincident within a tolerance of 3 feet when MLS is installed on a runway already served by an ILS. This requirement applies only if the ILS glide slope is sited such that the height of the reference datum meets the requirements of FAA Order 8260.34.

\(c\) *Antenna coordinates.* The scanning beams transmitted by the elevation subsystem must be conical.

\(d\) *Elevation accuracy.* (1) The accuracies shown in Table 13 are required at the approach reference datum. From the approach reference datum to the coverage limit, the PFE, PFN and CMN limits shall be allowed to linearly increase as follows:

\(i\) With distance along the runway centerline extended at the minimum glide path angle, by a factor of 1.2 for the PFE and PFN limits and to ±0.10 degree for the CMN limits;

\(ii\) With azimuth angle, from runway centerline extended to the coverage extreme, by a factor of 1.2 for the PFE and PFN limits and by a factor of 2.0 for the CMN limits;

\(iii\) With increasing elevation angles from + 3 degrees to + 15 degrees, by a factor of 2.0 for the PFE and PFN limits;

</div>

\(iv\) With decreasing elevation angle from + 3 degrees (or 60% of the minimum glide path angle, whichever is less) to the coverage extreme, by a factor of 3 for the PFE, PFN and CMN limits; and

\(v\) Maximum angular limits. the CMN limits shall not exceed ±0.10 degree in any coverage region within ±10 degrees laterally of runway centerline extended which is above the elevation angle specified in (iv) above.

<div>

Note: It is desirable that the CMN not exceed ±0.10 degree throughout the coverage region above the elevation angle specified in paragraph (d)(1)(iv) of this section.

</div>

\(2\) The system and ground subsystem accuracies shown in Table 13 are to be demonstrated at commissioning as maximum error limits. Subsequent to commissioning, the accuracies are to be considered at 95% probability limits.

\(e\) Elevation antenna characteristics are as follows:

\(1\) *Drift.* Any elevation angle as encoded by the scanning beam at any point within the coverage sector must not vary more than 0.04 degree over the range of service conditions specified in [[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.309   General requirements.|§171.309]](d) without the use of internal environmental controls. Multipath effects are excluded from this requirement.

\(2\) *Beam pointing errors.* The elevation angle as encoded by the scanning beam at any point within the coverage sector must not deviate from the true elevation angle at that point by more than ±0.04 degree for elevation angles from 2.5° to 3.5°. Above 3.5° these errors may linearly increase to ±0.1 degree at 7.5°. Multipath and drift effects are excluded from this requirement.

\(3\) *Antenna alignment.* The antenna must be equipped with suitable optical, electrical, or mechanical means or any combination of the three, to align the lowest operationally required glidepath to the true glidepath angle with a maximum error of 0.01 degree. Additionally, the elevation antenna bias adjustment must be electronically steerable at least to the monitor limits in steps not greater than 0.005 degrees.

\(4\) *Antenna far field patterns in the plane of scan.* On the lowest operationally required glidepath, the antenna mainlobe pattern must conform to Figure 10, and the beamwidth must be such that in the installed environment, no significant ground reflections of the mainlobe exist. In any case, the beamwidth must not exceed 2 degrees. The antenna mainlobe may be allowed to broaden from the value at boresight by a factor of 1/cosθ, where θ is the angle of boresight. Anywhere within coverage, the −3 dB width of the antenna mainlobe, while scanning normally, must not be less than 25 microseconds (0.5 degrees) or greater than 250 microseconds (5 degrees). The sidelobe levels must be as follows:

\(i\) *Dynamic sidelobe levels.* With the antenna scanning normally, the dynamic sidelobe level that is detected by a receiver at any point within the proportional coverage sector must be down at least 10 dB from the peak of the mainlobe. Outside the proportional coverage sector, the radiation from the scanning beam antenna must be of such a nature that receiver warnings will not be removed or a suitable OCI signal must be provided.

\(ii\) *Effective sidelobe levels.* With the antenna scanning normally, the sidelobe levels in the plane of scan must be such that, when reflected from the ground, the resultant PFE along any glidepath does not exceed 0.083 degrees.

\(5\) *Antenna far field pattern in the horizontal plane.* The horizontal pattern of the antenna must gradually de-emphasize the signal away from antenna boresight. Typically, the horizontal pattern should be reduced by at least 3 dB at 20 degrees off boresight and by at least 6 dB at 40 degrees off boresight. Depending on the actual multipath conditions, the horizontal radiation patterns may require more or less de-emphasis.

\(6\) *Data antenna.* The data antenna must have horizontal and vertical patterns as required for its function.

\(f\) *False guidance.* False courses which can be acquired and tracked by an aircraft shall not exist anywhere either inside or outside of the MLS coverage sector. False courses which exist outside of the minimum coverage sector may be suppressed by the use of OCI.

<div>

Note: False courses may be due to (but not limited to) MLS airborne receiver acquisition of the following types of false guidance: reflections of the scanning beam and scanning beam antenna sidelobes and grating lobes.

</div>

### §171.319   Approach elevation monitor system requirements.

\(a\) The monitor system must act to ensure that any of the following conditions do not persist for longer than the periods specified when:

\(1\) There is a change in the ground component contribution to the mean glidepath error component such that the path following error on any glidepath exceeds the limits specified in [[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.317   Approach elevation performance requirements.|§171.317]](d) for a period of more than one second.

<div>

Note: The above requirement and the requirement to limit the ground equipment mean error to ±0.067 degree can be satisfied by the following procedure. The integral monitor alarm limit should be set to ±0.067 degree. This will limit the electrical component of mean glidepath error to ±0.067 degree. The field monitor alarm limit should be set such that with the mean glidepath error at the alarm limit the total allowed PFE is not exceeded on any commissioned glidepath from the limit of coverage to an altitude of 100 feet.

</div>

\(2\) There is a reduction in the radiated power to a level not less than that specified in [[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.317   Approach elevation performance requirements.|§171.317]](a)(4) for a period of more than one second.

\(3\) There is an error in the preamble DPSK transmission which occurs more than once in any one second period.

\(4\) There is an error in the time division multiplex synchronization of a particular elevation function such that the requirement specified in [[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.311   Signal format requirements.|§171.311]](e) is not satisfied and this condition persists for more than one second.

\(5\) A failure of the monitor is detected.

\(b\) The period during which erroneous guidance information is radiated must not exceed the periods specified in [[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.319   Approach elevation monitor system requirements.|§171.319]](a). If the fault is not cleared within the time allowed, radiation shall cease. After shutdown, no attempt must be made to restore service until a period of 20 seconds has elapsed.

### §171.321   DME and marker beacon performance requirements.

\(a\) The DME equipment must meet the performance requirements prescribed in subpart G of the part. This subpart imposes requirements that performance features must comply with International Standards and Recommended Practices, Aeronautical Telecommunications, Vol. I of Annex 10 to ICAO. It is available from ICAO, Aviation Building, 1080 University Street, Montreal 101, Quebec, Canada, Attention: Distribution Officer and also available for inspection at the National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). For information on the availability of this material at NARA, call 202-741-6030, or go to: *http://www.archives.gov/federal\_\_register/code\_\_of\_\_federal\_\_regulations/ibr\_\_locations.html.*

\(b\) MLS marker beacon equipment must meet the performance requirements prescribed in subpart H of this part. This subpart imposes requirements that performance features must comply with International Standards and Recommended Practices, Aeronautical Telecommuncations, Vol. I of Annex 10 to ICAO.

\[Doc. No. 5034, 29 FR 11337, Aug. 6, 1964, as amended at 69 FR 18803, Apr. 9, 2004\]

### §171.323   Fabrication and installation requirements.

\(a\) The MLS facility must be permanent and must be located, constructed, and installed in accordance with best commercial engineering practices, using applicable electric and safety codes and Federal Communications Commission (FCC) licensing requirements and siting requirements of §[[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.313   Azimuth performance requirements.|§171.313]](b) and 171.317(b).

\(b\) The MLS facility components must utilize solid state technology except that traveling wave tube amplifiers (TWTA) may be used. A maximum level of common modularity must be provided along with diagnostics to facilitate maintenance and troubleshooting.

\(c\) An approved monitoring capability must be provided which indicates the status of the equipment at the site and at a remotely located maintenance area, with monitor capability that provides pre-alarm of impending system failures. This monitoring feature must be capable of transmitting the status and pre-alarm over standard phone lines to a remote section. In the event the sponsor requests the FAA to assume ownership of the facility, the monitoring feature must also be capable of interfacing with FAA remote monitoring requirements. This requirement may be complied with by the addition of optional software and/or hardware in space provided in the original equipment.

\(d\) The mean corrective maintenance time of the MLS equipment must be equal to or less than 0.5 hours with a maximum corrective maintenance time not to exceed 1.5 hours. This measure applies to correction of unscheduled failures of the monitor, transmitter and associated antenna assemblies, limited to unscheduled outage and out of tolerance conditions.

\(e\) The mean-time-between-failures of the MLS angle system must not be less than 1,500 hours. This measure applies to unscheduled outage, out-of-tolerance conditions, and failures of the monitor, transmitter, and associated antenna assemblies.

\(f\) The MLS facility must have a reliable source of suitable primary power, either from a power distribution system or locally generated. Adequate power capacity must be provided for the operation of the MLS as well as the test and working equipment of the MLS.

\(g\) The MLS facility must have a continuously engaged or floating battery power source for the continued normal operation of the ground station operation if the primary power fails. A trickle charge must be supplied to recharge the batteries during the period of available primary power. Upon loss and subsequent restoration of power, the battery must be restored to full charge within 24 hours. When primary power is applied, the state of the battery charge must not affect the operation of the MLS ground station. The battery must allow continuation of normal operation of the MLS facility for at least 2 hours without the use of additional sources of power. When the system is operating from the battery supply without prime power, the radome deicers and the environmental system need not operate. The equipment must meet all specification requirements with or without batteries installed.

\(h\) There must be a means for determining, from the ground, the performance of the system including antenna, both initially and periodically.

\(i\) The facility must have, or be supplemented by, ground, air, or landline communications services. At facilities within or immediately adjacent to controlled airspace, that are intended for use as instrument approach aids for an airport, there must be ground air communications or reliable communications (at least a landline telephone) from the airport to the nearest FAA air traffic control or communication facility. Compliance with this paragraph need not be shown at airports where an adjacent FAA facility can communicate with aircraft on the ground at the airport and during the entire proposed instrument approach procedure. In addition, at low traffic density airports within or immediately adjacent to controlled airspace, and where extensive delays are not a factor, the requirements of this paragraph may be reduced to reliable communications from the airport to the nearest FAA air traffic control or communications facility. If the adjacent FAA facility can communicate with aircraft during the proposed instrument approach procedure down to the airport surface or at least down to the minimum en route altitude, this would require at least a landline telephone.

\(j\) The location of the phase center for all antennas must be clearly marked on the antenna enclosures.

\(k\) The latitude, longitude and mean sea level elevation of all MLS antennas, runway threshold and runway stop end must be determined by survey with an accuracy of ±3 meters (±10 feet) laterally and ±0.3 meter (±1.0 foot) vertically. The relative lateral and vertical offsets of all antenna phase centers, and both runway ends must be determined with an accuracy of ±0.3 meter (±1.0 foot) laterally and ±0.03 meter (±0.1 foot) vertically. The owner must bear all costs of the survey. The results of this survey must be included in the “operations and maintenance” manual required by section 171.325 of this subpart and will be noted on FAA Form 198 required by [[Volume 3/J Navigational facilities/0171 Non-federal navigation facilities.md#§171.327   Operational records.|§171.327]].

\[Doc. No. 20669, 51 FR 33177, Sept. 18, 1986, as amended by Amdt. 171-16, 56 FR 65665, Dec. 17, 1991\]
