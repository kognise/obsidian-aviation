\(b\) The Administrator may suspend or terminate any operations specifications issued under this part if the Administrator determines that safety in air commerce and the public interest require the suspension or termination;

\(c\) Except as provided in paragraphs (f) and (g) of this section, when the Administrator initiates an action to amend, suspend or terminate a foreign air carrier or foreign person's operations specifications, the following procedure applies:

\(1\) The responsible Flight Standards office notifies the foreign air carrier or foreign person in writing of the proposed amendment, suspension or termination.

\(2\) The responsible Flight Standards office sets a reasonable period (but not less than 7 days) within which the foreign air carrier or foreign person may submit written information, views, and arguments on the amendment, suspension or termination.

\(3\) After considering all material presented, the responsible Flight Standards office notifies the foreign air carrier or foreign person of—

\(i\) The adoption of the proposed amendment, suspension or termination;

\(ii\) The partial adoption of the proposed amendment, suspension or termination; or

\(iii\) The withdrawal of the proposed amendment, suspension or termination.

This section also applies to foreign air carriers or foreign persons operating any other U.S.-registered transport category, turbine-powered airplane with a type certificate issued after January 1, 1958, regardless of the maximum takeoff gross weight, for which a limit of validity of the engineering data that supports the structural maintenance program (hereafter referred to as LOV) is required in accordance with §25.571 or §26.21 of this chapter after January 14, 2011.

\(b\) *Limit of validity.* No foreign air carrier or foreign person may operate a U.S.-registered airplane identified in paragraph (a) of this section after the applicable date identified in Table 1 of this section, unless an Airworthiness Limitations section (ALS) approved under Appendix H to part 25 or §26.21 of this chapter is incorporated into its maintenance program. The ALS must—

\(1\) Include an LOV approved under §25.571 or §26.21 of this chapter, as applicable, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section; and

\(2\) Be clearly distinguishable within its maintenance program.

\(c\) *Operation of airplanes excluded from §26.21.* No certificate holder may operate an airplane identified in §26.21(g) of this chapter after July 14, 2013, unless an ALS approved under Appendix H to part 25 or §26.21 of this chapter is incorporated into its maintenance program. The ALS must—

\(1\) Include an LOV approved under §25.571 or §26.21 of this chapter, as applicable, except as provided in paragraph (f) of this section; and

\(2\) Be clearly distinguishable within its maintenance program

\(d\) *Extended limit of validity.* No foreign air carrier or foreign person may operate an airplane beyond the LOV or extended LOV specified in paragraph (b)(1), (c), (d), or (f) of this section, as applicable, unless the following conditions are met:

\(i\) Includes an extended LOV and any widespread fatigue damage airworthiness limitation items (ALIs) approved under §26.23 of this chapter; and

\(ii\) Is approved under §26.23 of this chapter;

\(2\) The extended LOV and the airworthiness limitation items pertaining to widespread fatigue damage must be clearly distinguishable within its maintenance program.

\(e\) *Principal Maintenance Inspector approval.* Foreign air carriers or foreign persons must submit the maintenance program revisions required by paragraphs (b), (c), and (d) of this section to the Principal Maintenance Inspector or Flight Standards office for review and approval.

\(f\) *Exception.* For any airplane for which an LOV has not been approved as of the applicable compliance date specified in paragraph (c) or Table 1 of this section, instead of including an approved LOV in the ALS, an operator must include the applicable default LOV specified in Table 1 or Table 2 of this section, as applicable, in the ALS.

\(3\) For those foreign air carriers or foreign persons that have only one airplane for a model identified in Table 1, the airplane must be modified no later than December 26, 2017.

\(f\) *Compliance after Installation.* Except in accordance with §129.14, no person may—

\(1\) Operate an airplane on which IMM or FRM has been installed before the dates specified in paragraph (e) of this section unless the IMM or FRM is operational.

\(2\) Deactivate or remove an IMM or FRM once installed unless it is replaced by a means that complies with paragraph (d) of this section.

\(g\) *Maintenance Program Revisions.* No foreign air carrier or foreign person may operate an airplane for which airworthiness limitations have been approved by the responsible Aircraft Certification Service office in accordance with §§26.33, 26.35, or 26.37 of this chapter after the airplane is modified in accordance with paragraph (d) of this section unless the maintenance program for that airplane is revised to include those applicable airworthiness limitations.

\(h\) After the maintenance program is revised as required by paragraph (g) of this section, before returning an airplane to service after any alteration for which airworthiness limitations are required by §§25.981, 26.33, 26.35, or 26.37 of this chapter, the foreign person or foreign air carrier must revise the maintenance program for the airplane to include those airworthiness limitations.

\(i\) The maintenance program changes identified in paragraphs (g) and (h) of this section must be submitted to the operator's responsible Flight Standards office or Principal Inspector for review and approval prior to incorporation.

\(j\) The requirements of paragraph (d) of this section do not apply to airplanes operated in all-cargo service, but those airplanes are subject to paragraph (f) of this section.
