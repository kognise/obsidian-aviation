### §135.178   Additional emergency equipment.

No person may operate an airplane having a passenger seating configuration of more than 19 seats, unless it has the additional emergency equipment specified in paragraphs (a) through (l) of this section.

\(a\) *Means for emergency evacuation.* Each passenger-carrying landplane emergency exit (other than over-the-wing) that is more than 6 feet from the ground, with the airplane on the ground and the landing gear extended, must have an approved means to assist the occupants in descending to the ground. The assisting means for a floor-level emergency exit must meet the requirements of [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes.md#§25.809   Emergency exit arrangement.|§25.809]](f)(1) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972, except that, for any airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed after that date, it must meet the requirements under which the airplane was type certificated. An assisting means that deploys automatically must be armed during taxiing, takeoffs, and landings; however, the Administrator may grant a deviation from the requirement of automatic deployment if he finds that the design of the exit makes compliance impractical, if the assisting means automatically erects upon deployment and, with respect to required emergency exits, if an emergency evacuation demonstration is conducted in accordance with [[Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0121 Operating requirements  domestic, flag, and supplemental operations.md#§121.291   Demonstration of emergency evacuation procedures.|§121.291]](a) of this chapter. This paragraph does not apply to the rear window emergency exit of Douglas DC-3 airplanes operated with fewer than 36 occupants, including crewmembers, and fewer than five exits authorized for passenger use.

\(b\) *Interior emergency exit marking.* The following must be complied with for each passenger-carrying airplane:

\(1\) Each passenger emergency exit, its means of access, and its means of opening must be conspicuously marked. The identity and locating of each passenger emergency exit must be recognizable from a distance equal to the width of the cabin. The location of each passenger emergency exit must be indicated by a sign visible to occupants approaching along the main passenger aisle. There must be a locating sign—

\(i\) Above the aisle near each over-the-wing passenger emergency exit, or at another ceiling location if it is more practical because of low headroom;

\(ii\) Next to each floor level passenger emergency exit, except that one sign may serve two such exits if they both can be seen readily from that sign; and

\(iii\) On each bulkhead or divider that prevents fore and aft vision along the passenger cabin, to indicate emergency exits beyond and obscured by it, except that if this is not possible, the sign may be placed at another appropriate location.

\(2\) Each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign must meet the following:

\(i\) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to meet the requirements of [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes.md#§25.812   Emergency lighting.|§25.812]](b) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972. On these airplanes, no sign may continue to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts. The colors may be reversed if it increases the emergency illumination of the passenger compartment. However, the Administrator may authorize deviation from the 2-inch background requirements if he finds that special circumstances exist that make compliance impractical and that the proposed deviation provides an equivalent level of safety.

\(ii\) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, each passenger emergency exit marking and each locating sign must be manufactured to meet the interior emergency exit marking requirements under which the airplane was type certificated. On these airplanes, no sign may continue to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 250 microlamberts.

\(c\) *Lighting for interior emergency exit markings.* Each passenger-carrying airplane must have an emergency lighting system, independent of the main lighting system; however, sources of general cabin illumination may be common to both the emergency and the main lighting systems if the power supply to the emergency lighting system is independent of the power supply to the main lighting system. The emergency lighting system must—

\(1\) Illuminate each passenger exit marking and locating sign;

\(2\) Provide enough general lighting in the passenger cabin so that the average illumination when measured at 40-inch intervals at seat armrest height, on the centerline of the main passenger aisle, is at least 0.05 foot-candles; and

\(3\) For airplanes type certificated after January 1, 1958, include floor proximity emergency escape path marking which meets the requirements of [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes.md#§25.812   Emergency lighting.|§25.812]](e) of this chapter in effect on November 26, 1984.

\(d\) *Emergency light operation.* Except for lights forming part of emergency lighting subsystems provided in compliance with [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes.md#§25.812   Emergency lighting.|§25.812]](h) of this chapter (as prescribed in paragraph (h) of this section) that serve no more than one assist means, are independent of the airplane's main emergency lighting systems, and are automatically activated when the assist means is deployed, each light required by paragraphs (c) and (h) of this section must:

\(1\) Be operable manually both from the flightcrew station and from a point in the passenger compartment that is readily accessible to a normal flight attendant seat;

\(2\) Have a means to prevent inadvertent operation of the manual controls;

\(3\) When armed or turned on at either station, remain lighted or become lighted upon interruption of the airplane's normal electric power;

\(4\) Be armed or turned on during taxiing, takeoff, and landing. In showing compliance with this paragraph, a transverse vertical separation of the fuselage need not be considered;

\(5\) Provide the required level of illumination for at least 10 minutes at the critical ambient conditions after emergency landing; and

\(6\) Have a cockpit control device that has an “on,” “off,” and “armed” position.

\(e\) *Emergency exit operating handles.* (1) For a passenger-carrying airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the location of each passenger emergency exit operating handle, and instructions for opening the exit, must be shown by a marking on or near the exit that is readable from a distance of 30 inches. In addition, for each Type I and Type II emergency exit with a locking mechanism released by rotary motion of the handle, the instructions for opening must be shown by—

\(i\) A red arrow with a shaft at least three-fourths inch wide and a head twice the width of the shaft, extending along at least 70° of arc at a radius approximately equal to three-fourths of the handle length; and

\(ii\) The word “open” in red letters 1 inch high placed horizontally near the head of the arrow.

\(2\) For a passenger-carrying airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the location of each passenger emergency exit operating handle and instructions for opening the exit must be shown in accordance with the requirements under which the airplane was type certificated. On these airplanes, no operating handle or operating handle cover may continue to be used if its luminescence (brightness) decreases to below 100 microlamberts.

\(f\) *Emergency exit access.* Access to emergency exits must be provided as follows for each passenger-carrying airplane:

\(1\) Each passageway between individual passenger areas, or leading to a Type I or Type II emergency exit, must be unobstructed and at least 20 inches wide.

\(2\) There must be enough space next to each Type I or Type II emergency exit to allow a crewmember to assist in the evacuation of passengers without reducing the unobstructed width of the passageway below that required in paragraph (f)(1) of this section; however, the Administrator may authorize deviation from this requirement for an airplane certificated under the provisions of part 4b of the Civil Air Regulations in effect before December 20, 1951, if he finds that special circumstances exist that provide an equivalent level of safety.

\(3\) There must be access from the main aisle to each Type III and Type IV exit. The access from the aisle to these exits must not be obstructed by seats, berths, or other protrusions in a manner that would reduce the effectiveness of the exit. In addition, for a transport category airplane type certificated after January 1, 1958, there must be placards installed in accordance with [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes.md#§25.813   Emergency exit access.|§25.813]](c)(3) of this chapter for each Type III exit after December 3, 1992.

\(4\) If it is necessary to pass through a passageway between passenger compartments to reach any required emergency exit from any seat in the passenger cabin, the passageway must not be obstructed. Curtains may, however, be used if they allow free entry through the passageway.

\(5\) No door may be installed in any partition between passenger compartments.

\(6\) If it is necessary to pass through a doorway separating the passenger cabin from other areas to reach a required emergency exit from any passenger seat, the door must have a means to latch it in the open position, and the door must be latched open during each takeoff and landing. The latching means must be able to withstand the loads imposed upon it when the door is subjected to the ultimate inertia forces, relative to the surrounding structure, listed in [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes.md#§25.561   General.|§25.561]](b) of this chapter.

\(g\) *Exterior exit markings.* Each passenger emergency exit and the means of opening that exit from the outside must be marked on the outside of the airplane. There must be a 2-inch colored band outlining each passenger emergency exit on the side of the fuselage. Each outside marking, including the band, must be readily distinguishable from the surrounding fuselage area by contrast in color. The markings must comply with the following:

\(1\) If the reflectance of the darker color is 15 percent or less, the reflectance of the lighter color must be at least 45 percent.

\(2\) If the reflectance of the darker color is greater than 15 percent, at least a 30 percent difference between its reflectance and the reflectance of the lighter color must be provided.

\(3\) Exits that are not in the side of the fuselage must have the external means of opening and applicable instructions marked conspicuously in red or, if red is inconspicuous against the background color, in bright chrome yellow and, when the opening means for such an exit is located on only one side of the fuselage, a conspicuous marking to that effect must be provided on the other side. “Reflectance” is the ratio of the luminous flux reflected by a body to the luminous flux it receives.

\(h\) *Exterior emergency lighting and escape route.* (1) Each passenger-carrying airplane must be equipped with exterior lighting that meets the following requirements:

\(i\) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the requirements of [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes.md#§25.812   Emergency lighting.|§25.812]] (f) and (g) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972.

\(ii\) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the exterior emergency lighting requirements under which the airplane was type certificated.

\(2\) Each passenger-carrying airplane must be equipped with a slip-resistant escape route that meets the following requirements:

\(i\) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed prior to May 1, 1972, the requirements of [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes.md#§25.803   Emergency evacuation.|§25.803]](e) of this chapter in effect on April 30, 1972.

\(ii\) For an airplane for which the application for the type certificate was filed on or after May 1, 1972, the slip-resistant escape route requirements under which the airplane was type certificated.

\(i\) *Floor level exits.* Each floor level door or exit in the side of the fuselage (other than those leading into a cargo or baggage compartment that is not accessible from the passenger cabin) that is 44 or more inches high and 20 or more inches wide, but not wider than 46 inches, each passenger ventral exit (except the ventral exits on Martin 404 and Convair 240 airplanes), and each tail cone exit, must meet the requirements of this section for floor level emergency exits. However, the Administrator may grant a deviation from this paragraph if he finds that circumstances make full compliance impractical and that an acceptable level of safety has been achieved.

\(j\) *Additional emergency exits.* Approved emergency exits in the passenger compartments that are in excess of the minimum number of required emergency exits must meet all of the applicable provisions of this section, except paragraphs (f) (1), (2), and (3) of this section, and must be readily accessible.

\(k\) On each large passenger-carrying turbojet-powered airplane, each ventral exit and tailcone exit must be—

\(1\) Designed and constructed so that it cannot be opened during flight; and

\(2\) Marked with a placard readable from a distance of 30 inches and installed at a conspicuous location near the means of opening the exit, stating that the exit has been designed and constructed so that it cannot be opened during flight.

\(b\) For the purpose of this subpart, *effective length of the runway,* for landing means the distance from the point at which the obstruction clearance plane associated with the approach end of the runway intersects the centerline of the runway to the far end of the runway.

\(c\) For the purpose of this subpart, *obstruction clearance plane* means a plane sloping upward from the runway at a slope of 1:20 to the horizontal, and tangent to or clearing all obstructions within a specified area surrounding the runway as shown in a profile view of that area. In the plan view, the centerline of the specified area coincides with the centerline of the runway, beginning at the point where the obstruction clearance plane intersects the centerline of the runway and proceeding to a point at least 1,500 feet from the beginning point. After that the centerline coincides with the takeoff path over the ground for the runway (in the case of takeoffs) or with the instrument approach counterpart (for landings), or, where the applicable one of these paths has not been established, it proceeds consistent with turns of at least 4,000-foot radius until a point is reached beyond which the obstruction clearance plane clears all obstructions. This area extends laterally 200 feet on each side of the centerline at the point where the obstruction clearance plane intersects the runway and continues at this width to the end of the runway; then it increases uniformly to 500 feet on each side of the centerline at a point 1,500 feet from the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane with the runway; after that it extends laterally 500 feet on each side of the centerline.

\(a\) No person operating a reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane unless it is possible—

\(1\) To stop the airplane safely on the runway, as shown by the accelerate-stop distance data, at any time during takeoff until reaching critical-engine failure speed;

\(2\) If the critical engine fails at any time after the airplane reaches critical-engine failure speed V1, to continue the takeoff and reach a height of 50 feet, as indicated by the takeoff path data, before passing over the end of the runway; and

\(3\) To clear all obstacles either by at least 50 feet vertically (as shown by the takeoff path data) or 200 feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and 300 feet horizontally beyond the boundaries, without banking before reaching a height of 50 feet (as shown by the takeoff path data) and after that without banking more than 15 degrees.

\(b\) In applying this section, corrections must be made for any runway gradient. To allow for wind effect, takeoff data based on still air may be corrected by taking into account not more than 50 percent of any reported headwind component and not less than 150 percent of any reported tailwind component.

### §135.369   Large transport category airplanes: Reciprocating engine powered: En route limitations: All engines operating.

\(a\) No person operating a reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil, that does not allow a rate of climb (in feet per minute), with all engines operating, of at least 6.90 Vso (that is, the number of feet per minute obtained by multiplying the number of knots by 6.90) at an altitude of a least 1,000 feet above the highest ground or obstruction within ten miles of each side of the intended track.

\(b\) This section does not apply to large transport category airplanes certificated under part 4a of the Civil Air Regulations.

However, for the purposes of this paragraph the rate of climb for transport category airplanes certificated under part 4a of the Civil Air Regulations is 0.026 Vso2.

\(b\) In place of the requirements of paragraph (a) of this section, a person may, under an approved procedure, operate a reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane at an all-engines-operating altitude that allows the airplane to continue, after an engine failure, to an alternate airport where a landing can be made under [[Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft.md#§135.377   Large transport category airplanes: Reciprocating engine powered: Landing limitations: Alternate airports.|§135.377]], allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil. After the assumed failure, the flight path must clear the ground and any obstruction within five miles on each side of the intended track by at least 2,000 feet.

\(c\) If an approved procedure under paragraph (b) of this section is used, the certificate holder shall comply with the following:

\(1\) The rate of climb (as prescribed in the Airplane Flight Manual for the appropriate weight and altitude) used in calculating the airplane's flight path shall be diminished by an amount in feet per minute, equal to (0.079−0.106/N) Vso2 (when N is the number of engines installed and Vso is expressed in knots) for airplanes certificated under [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes.md|part 25 of this chapter]] and by 0.026 Vso2 for airplanes certificated under part 4a of the Civil Air Regulations.

\(2\) The all-engines-operating altitude shall be sufficient so that in the event the critical engine becomes inoperative at any point along the route, the flight will be able to proceed to a predetermined alternate airport by use of this procedure. In determining the takeoff weight, the airplane is assumed to pass over the critical obstruction following engine failure at a point no closer to the critical obstruction than the nearest approved navigational fix, unless the Administrator approves a procedure established on a different basis upon finding that adequate operational safeguards exist.

\(3\) The airplane must meet the provisions of paragraph (a) of this section at 1,000 feet above the airport used as an alternate in this procedure.

\(4\) The procedure must include an approved method of accounting for winds and temperatures that would otherwise adversely affect the flight path.

\(5\) In complying with this procedure, fuel jettisoning is allowed if the certificate holder shows that it has an adequate training program, that proper instructions are given to the flight crew, and all other precautions are taken to ensure a safe procedure.

\(6\) The certificate holder and the pilot in command shall jointly elect an alternate airport for which the appropriate weather reports or forecasts, or any combination of them, indicate that weather conditions will be at or above the alternate weather minimum specified in the certificate holder's operations specifications for that airport when the flight arrives.

### §135.373   Part 25 transport category airplanes with four or more engines: Reciprocating engine powered: En route limitations: Two engines inoperative.

\(a\) No person may operate an airplane certificated under part 25 and having four or more engines unless—

\(1\) There is no place along the intended track that is more than 90 minutes (with all engines operating at cruising power) from an airport that meets [[Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft.md#§135.377   Large transport category airplanes: Reciprocating engine powered: Landing limitations: Alternate airports.|§135.377]]; or

\(2\) It is operated at a weight allowing the airplane, with the two critical engines inoperative, to climb at 0.013 Vso2 feet per minute (that is, the number of feet per minute obtained by multiplying the number of knots squared by 0.013) at an altitude of 1,000 feet above the highest ground or obstruction within 10 miles on each side of the intended track, or at an altitude of 5,000 feet, whichever is higher.

\(b\) For the purposes of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is assumed that—

\(1\) The two engines fail at the point that is most critical with respect to the takeoff weight;

\(2\) Consumption of fuel and oil is normal with all engines operating up to the point where the two engines fail with two engines operating beyond that point;

\(3\) Where the engines are assumed to fail at an altitude above the prescribed minimum altitude, compliance with the prescribed rate of climb at the prescribed minimum altitude need not be shown during the descent from the cruising altitude to the prescribed minimum altitude, if those requirements can be met once the prescribed minimum altitude is reached, and assuming descent to be along a net flight path and the rate of descent to be 0.013 Vso2 greater than the rate in the approved performance data; and

\(4\) If fuel jettisoning is provided, the airplane's weight at the point where the two engines fail is considered to be not less than that which would include enough fuel to proceed to an airport meeting [[Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft.md#§135.377   Large transport category airplanes: Reciprocating engine powered: Landing limitations: Alternate airports.|§135.377]] and to arrive at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet directly over that airport.

\(a\) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person operating a reciprocating engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane, unless its weight on arrival, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight, would allow a full stop landing at the intended destination within 60 percent of the effective length of each runway described below from a point 50 feet directly above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the purposes of determining the allowable landing weight at the destination airport the following is assumed:

\(1\) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the most favorable direction in still air.

\(2\) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering the probable wind velocity and direction (forecast for the expected time of arrival), the ground handling characteristics of the type of airplane, and other conditions such as landing aids and terrain, and allowing for the effect of the landing path and roll of not more than 50 percent of the headwind component or not less than 150 percent of the tailwind component.

\(b\) An airplane that would be prohibited from being taken off because it could not meet paragraph (a)(2) of this section may be taken off if an alternate airport is selected that meets all of this section except that the airplane can accomplish a full stop landing within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway.

### §135.377   Large transport category airplanes: Reciprocating engine powered: Landing limitations: Alternate airports.

No person may list an airport as an alternate airport in a flight plan unless the airplane (at the weight anticipated at the time of arrival at the airport), based on the assumptions in [[Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft.md#§135.375   Large transport category airplanes: Reciprocating engine powered: Landing limitations: Destination airports.|§135.375]](a) (1) and (2), can be brought to a full stop landing within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway.

### §135.379   Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine powered: Takeoff limitations.

\(a\) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the airport and for the ambient temperature existing at take- off.

\(b\) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane certificated after August 26, 1957, but before August 30, 1959 (SR422, 422A), may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual for the minimum distance required for takeoff. In the case of an airplane certificated after September 30, 1958 (SR422A, 422B), the takeoff distance may include a clearway distance but the clearway distance included may not be greater than one-half of the takeoff run.

\(c\) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane certificated after August 29, 1959 (SR422B), may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual at which compliance with the following may be shown:

\(1\) The accelerate-stop distance, as defined in [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes.md#§25.109   Accelerate-stop distance.|§25.109]] of this chapter, must not exceed the length of the runway plus the length of any stopway.

\(2\) The takeoff distance must not exceed the length of the runway plus the length of any clearway except that the length of any clearway included must not be greater than one-half the length of the runway.

\(3\) The takeoff run must not be greater than the length of the runway.

\(d\) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight greater than that listed in the Airplane Flight Manual—

\(1\) For an airplane certificated after August 26, 1957, but before October 1, 1958 (SR422), that allows a takeoff path that clears all obstacles either by at least (35 + 0.01 D) feet vertically (D is the distance along the intended flight path from the end of the runway in feet), or by at least 200 feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and by at least 300 feet horizontally after passing the boundaries; or

\(2\) For an airplane certificated after September 30, 1958 (SR422A, 422B), that allows a net takeoff flight path that clears all obstacles either by a height of at least 35 feet vertically, or by at least 200 feet horizontally within the airport boundaries and by at least 300 feet horizontally after passing the boundaries.

\(e\) In determining maximum weights, minimum distances, and flight paths under paragraphs (a) through (d) of this section, correction must be made for the runway to be used, the elevation of the airport, the effective runway gradient, the ambient temperature and wind component at the time of takeoff, and, if operating limitations exist for the minimum distances required for takeoff from wet runways, the runway surface condition (dry or wet). Wet runway distances associated with grooved or porous friction course runways, if provided in the Airplane Flight Manual, may be used only for runways that are grooved or treated with a porous friction course (PFC) overlay, and that the operator determines are designed, constructed, and maintained in a manner acceptable to the Administrator.

\(f\) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that the airplane is not banked before reaching a height of 50 feet, as shown by the takeoff path or net takeoff flight path data (as appropriate) in the Airplane Flight Manual, and after that the maximum bank is not more than 15 degrees.

\(g\) For the purposes of this section, the terms, *takeoff distance, takeoff run, net takeoff flight path,* have the same meanings as set forth in the rules under which the airplane was certificated.

### §135.381   Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine powered: En route limitations: One engine inoperative.

\(a\) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil, that is greater than that which (under the approved, one engine inoperative, en route net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual for that airplane) will allow compliance with paragraph (a) (1) or (2) of this section, based on the ambient temperatures expected en route.

\(1\) There is a positive slope at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above all terrain and obstructions within five statute miles on each side of the intended track, and, in addition, if that airplane was certificated after August 29, 1958 (SR422B), there is a positive slope at 1,500 feet above the airport where the airplane is assumed to land after an engine fails.

\(2\) The net flight path allows the airplane to continue flight from the cruising altitude to an airport where a landing can be made under [[Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft.md#§135.387   Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine powered: Landing limitations: Alternate airports.|§135.387]] clearing all terrain and obstructions within five statute miles of the intended track by at least 2,000 feet vertically and with a positive slope at 1,000 feet above the airport where the airplane lands after an engine fails, or, if that airplane was certificated after September 30, 1958 (SR422A, 422B), with a positive slope at 1,500 feet above the airport where the airplane lands after an engine fails.

\(b\) For the purpose of paragraph (a)(2) of this section, it is assumed that—

\(1\) The engine fails at the most critical point en route;

\(2\) The airplane passes over the critical obstruction, after engine failure at a point that is no closer to the obstruction than the approved navigation fix, unless the Administrator authorizes a different procedure based on adequate operational safeguards;

\(3\) An approved method is used to allow for adverse winds;

\(4\) Fuel jettisoning will be allowed if the certificate holder shows that the crew is properly instructed, that the training program is adequate, and that all other precautions are taken to ensure a safe procedure;

\(5\) The alternate airport is selected and meets the prescribed weather minimums; and

\(6\) The consumption of fuel and oil after engine failure is the same as the consumption that is allowed for in the approved net flight path data in the Airplane Flight Manual.

### §135.385   Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine powered: Landing limitations: Destination airports.

\(a\) No person operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight that (allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight to the destination or alternate airport) the weight of the airplane on arrival would exceed the landing weight in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the destination or alternate airport and the ambient temperature anticipated at the time of landing.

\(b\) Except as provided in paragraph (c), (d), (e), or (f) of this section, no person operating a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane may take off that airplane unless its weight on arrival, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight (in accordance with the landing distance in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the destination airport and the wind conditions expected there at the time of landing), would allow a full stop landing at the intended destination airport within 60 percent of the effective length of each runway described below from a point 50 feet above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the purpose of determining the allowable landing weight at the destination airport the following is assumed:

\(1\) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the most favorable direction, in still air.

\(2\) The airplane is landed on the most suitable runway considering the probable wind velocity and direction and the ground handling characteristics of the airplane, and considering other conditions such as landing aids and terrain.

\(d\) Unless, based on a showing of actual operating landing techniques on wet runways, a shorter landing distance (but never less than that required by paragraph (b) of this section) has been approved for a specific type and model airplane and included in the Airplane Flight Manual, no person may take off a turbojet airplane when the appropriate weather reports or forecasts, or any combination of them, indicate that the runways at the destination airport may be wet or slippery at the estimated time of arrival unless the effective runway length at the destination airport is at least 115 percent of the runway length required under paragraph (b) of this section.

\(e\) A turbojet airplane that would be prohibited from being taken off because it could not meet paragraph (b)(2) of this section may be taken off if an alternate airport is selected that meets all of paragraph (b) of this section.

\(f\) An eligible on-demand operator may take off a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane on an on-demand flight if all of the following conditions exist:

\(2\) The airplane's weight on arrival, allowing for normal consumption of fuel and oil in flight (in accordance with the landing distance in the Airplane Flight Manual for the elevation of the destination airport and the wind conditions expected there at the time of landing), would allow a full stop landing at the intended destination airport within 80 percent of the effective length of each runway described below from a point 50 feet above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway. For the purpose of determining the allowable landing weight at the destination airport, the following is assumed:

\(i\) The airplane is landed on the most favorable runway and in the most favorable direction, in still air.

### §135.387   Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine powered: Landing limitations: Alternate airports.

\(a\) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person may select an airport as an alternate airport for a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane unless (based on the assumptions in [[Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft.md#§135.385   Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine powered: Landing limitations: Destination airports.|§135.385]](b)) that airplane, at the weight expected at the time of arrival, can be brought to a full stop landing within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway for turbo-propeller-powered airplanes and 60 percent of the effective length of the runway for turbojet airplanes, from a point 50 feet above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway.

\(b\) Eligible on-demand operators may select an airport as an alternate airport for a turbine engine powered large transport category airplane if (based on the assumptions in [[Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft.md#§135.385   Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine powered: Landing limitations: Destination airports.|§135.385]](f)) that airplane, at the weight expected at the time of arrival, can be brought to a full stop landing within 80 percent of the effective length of the runway from a point 50 feet above the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway.

\(a\) No person operating a large nontransport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight greater than the weight that would allow the airplane to be brought to a safe stop within the effective length of the runway, from any point during the takeoff before reaching 105 percent of minimum control speed (the minimum speed at which an airplane can be safely controlled in flight after an engine becomes inoperative) or 115 percent of the power off stalling speed in the takeoff configuration, whichever is greater.

\(b\) For the purposes of this section—

\(1\) It may be assumed that takeoff power is used on all engines during the acceleration;

\(2\) Not more than 50 percent of the reported headwind component, or not less than 150 percent of the reported tailwind component, may be taken into account;

\(3\) The average runway gradient (the difference between the elevations of the endpoints of the runway divided by the total length) must be considered if it is more than one-half of one percent;

\(4\) It is assumed that the airplane is operating in standard atmosphere; and

\(5\) For takeoff, *effective length of the runway* means the distance from the end of the runway at which the takeoff is started to a point at which the obstruction clearance plane associated with the other end of the runway intersects the runway centerline.

### §135.391   Large nontransport category airplanes: En route limitations: One engine inoperative.

\(a\) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, no person operating a large nontransport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight that does not allow a rate of climb of at least 50 feet a minute, with the critical engine inoperative, at an altitude of at least 1,000 feet above the highest obstruction within five miles on each side of the intended track, or 5,000 feet, whichever is higher.

\(b\) Without regard to paragraph (a) of this section, if the Administrator finds that safe operations are not impaired, a person may operate the airplane at an altitude that allows the airplane, in case of engine failure, to clear all obstructions within five miles on each side of the intended track by 1,000 feet. If this procedure is used, the rate of descent for the appropriate weight and altitude is assumed to be 50 feet a minute greater than the rate in the approved performance data. Before approving such a procedure, the Administrator considers the following for the route, route segement, or area concerned:

\(1\) The reliability of wind and weather forecasting.

\(2\) The location and kinds of navigation aids.

\(3\) The prevailing weather conditions, particularly the frequency and amount of turbulence normally encountered.

\(4\) Terrain features.

\(5\) Air traffic problems.

\(6\) Any other operational factors that affect the operations.

\(c\) For the purposes of this section, it is assumed that—

\(1\) The critical engine is inoperative;

\(2\) The propeller of the inoperative engine is in the minimum drag position;

\(3\) The wing flaps and landing gear are in the most favorable position;

\(4\) The operating engines are operating at the maximum continuous power available;

\(5\) The airplane is operating in standard atmosphere; and

\(6\) The weight of the airplane is progressively reduced by the anticipated consumption of fuel and oil.

### §135.393   Large nontransport category airplanes: Landing limitations: Destination airports.

\(a\) No person operating a large nontransport category airplane may take off that airplane at a weight that—

\(1\) Allowing for anticipated consumption of fuel and oil, is greater than the weight that would allow a full stop landing within 60 percent of the effective length of the most suitable runway at the destination airport; and

\(2\) Is greater than the weight allowable if the landing is to be made on the runway—

\(i\) With the greatest effective length in still air; and

\(ii\) Required by the probable wind, taking into account not more than 50 percent of the headwind component or not less than 150 percent of the tailwind component.

\(b\) For the purpose of this section, it is assumed that—

\(1\) The airplane passes directly over the intersection of the obstruction clearance plane and the runway at a height of 50 feet in a steady gliding approach at a true indicated airspeed of at least 1.3 Vso;

\(2\) The landing does not require exceptional pilot skill; and

\(3\) The airplane is operating in standard atmosphere.

### §135.395   Large nontransport category airplanes: Landing limitations: Alternate airports.

No person may select an airport as an alternate airport for a large nontransport category airplane unless that airplane (at the weight anticipated at the time of arrival), based on the assumptions in [[Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft.md#§135.393   Large nontransport category airplanes: Landing limitations: Destination airports.|§135.393]](b), can be brought to a full stop landing within 70 percent of the effective length of the runway.

2\. *References.* Unless otherwise provided, references in this appendix to specific sections of part 23 of the Federal Aviation Regulations (FAR part 23) are to those sections of part 23 in effect on March 30, 1967.

### Flight Requirements

3\. *General.* Compliance must be shown with the applicable requirements of subpart B of FAR part 23, as supplemented or modified in §§4 through 10.

### Performance

4\. *General.* (a) Unless otherwise prescribed in this appendix, compliance with each applicable performance requirement in sections 4 through 7 must be shown for ambient atmospheric conditions and still air.

\(b\) The performance must correspond to the propulsive thrust available under the particular ambient atmospheric conditions and the particular flight condition. The available propulsive thrust must correspond to engine power or thrust, not exceeding the approved power or thrust less—

\(1\) Installation losses; and

\(2\) The power or equivalent thrust absorbed by the accessories and services appropriate to the particular ambient atmospheric conditions and the particular flight condition.

\(c\) Unless otherwise prescribed in this appendix, the applicant must select the take-off, en route, and landing configurations for the airplane.

\(d\) The airplane configuration may vary with weight, altitude, and temperature, to the extent they are compatible with the operating procedures required by paragraph (e) of this section.

\(e\) Unless otherwise prescribed in this appendix, in determining the critical engine inoperative takeoff performance, the accelerate-stop distance, takeoff distance, changes in the airplane's configuration, speed, power, and thrust must be made under procedures established by the applicant for operation in service.

\(f\) Procedures for the execution of balked landings must be established by the applicant and included in the Airplane Flight Manual.

\(g\) The procedures established under paragraphs (e) and (f) of this section must—

\(1\) Be able to be consistently executed in service by a crew of average skill;

\(2\) Use methods or devices that are safe and reliable; and

\(3\) Include allowance for any time delays, in the execution of the procedures, that may reasonably be expected in service.

5\. *Takeoff.* (a) *General.* Takeoff speeds, the accelerate-stop distance, the takeoff distance, and the one-engine-inoperative takeoff flight path data (described in paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (f) of this section), must be determined for—

\(1\) Each weight, altitude, and ambient temperature within the operational limits selected by the applicant;

\(2\) The selected configuration for takeoff;

\(3\) The center of gravity in the most unfavorable position;

\(4\) The operating engine within approved operating limitations; and

\(5\) Takeoff data based on smooth, dry, hard-surface runway.

\(b\) *Takeoff speeds.* (1) The decision speed *V*1 is the calibrated airspeed on the ground at which, as a result of engine failure or other reasons, the pilot is assumed to have made a decision to continue or discontinue the takeoff. The speed *V*1 must be selected by the applicant but may not be less than—

\(i\) 1.10*VS*1;

\(ii\) 1.10*VMC*;

\(iii\) A speed that allows acceleration to *V*1 and stop under paragraph (c) of this section; or

\(iv\) A speed at which the airplane can be rotated for takeoff and shown to be adequate to safely continue the takeoff, using normal piloting skill, when the critical engine is suddenly made inoperative.

\(2\) The initial climb out speed *V*2, in terms of calibrated airspeed, must be selected by the applicant so as to allow the gradient of climb required in section 6(b)(2), but it must not be less than *V*1 or less than 1.2*VS*1.

\(3\) Other essential take off speeds necessary for safe operation of the airplane.

\(c\) *Accelerate-stop distance.* (1) The accelerate-stop distance is the sum of the distances necessary to—

\(i\) Accelerate the airplane from a standing start to *V*1; and

\(ii\) Come to a full stop from the point at which *V*1 is reached assuming that in the case of engine failure, failure of the critical engine is recognized by the pilot at the speed *V*1.

\(2\) Means other than wheel brakes may be used to determine the accelerate-stop distance if that means is available with the critical engine inoperative and—

\(i\) Is safe and reliable;

\(ii\) Is used so that consistent results can be expected under normal operating conditions; and

\(iii\) Is such that exceptional skill is not required to control the airplane.

\(d\) *All engines operating takeoff distance.* The all engine operating takeoff distance is the horizontal distance required to takeoff and climb to a height of 50 feet above the takeoff surface under the procedures in FAR 23.51(a).

\(e\) *One-engine-inoperative takeoff.* Determine the weight for each altitude and temperature within the operational limits established for the airplane, at which the airplane has the capability, after failure of the critical engine at *V*1 determined under paragraph (b) of this section, to take off and climb at not less than *V*2, to a height 1,000 feet above the takeoff surface and attain the speed and configuration at which compliance is shown with the en route one-engine-inoperative gradient of climb specified in section 6(c).

\(f\) *One-engine-inoperative takeoff flight path data.* The one-engine-inoperative takeoff flight path data consist of takeoff flight paths extending from a standing start to a point in the takeoff at which the airplane reaches a height 1,000 feet above the takeoff surface under paragraph (e) of this section.

6\. *Climb.* (a) *Landing climb: All-engines-operating.* The maximum weight must be determined with the airplane in the landing configuration, for each altitude, and ambient temperature within the operational limits established for the airplane, with the most unfavorable center of gravity, and out-of-ground effect in free air, at which the steady gradient of climb will not be less than 3.3 percent, with:

\(1\) The engines at the power that is available 8 seconds after initiation of movement of the power or thrust controls from the minimum flight idle to the takeoff position.

\(2\) A climb speed not greater than the approach speed established under section 7 and not less than the greater of 1.05*VMC* or 1.10*VS*1.

\(b\) *Takeoff climb: one-engine-inoperative.* The maximum weight at which the airplane meets the minimum climb performance specified in paragraphs (1) and (2) of this paragraph must be determined for each altitude and ambient temperature within the operational limits established for the airplane, out of ground effect in free air, with the airplane in the takeoff configuration, with the most unfavorable center of gravity, the critical engine inoperative, the remaining engines at the maximum takeoff power or thrust, and the propeller of the inoperative engine windmilling with the propeller controls in the normal position except that, if an approved automatic feathering system is installed, the propellers may be in the feathered position:

\(1\) *Takeoff: landing gear extended.* The minimum steady gradient of climb must be measurably positive at the speed *V*1.

\(2\) *Takeoff: landing gear retracted.* The minimum steady gradient of climb may not be less than 2 percent at speed *V*2. For airplanes with fixed landing gear this requirement must be met with the landing gear extended.

\(c\) *En route climb: one-engine-inoperative.* The maximum weight must be determined for each altitude and ambient temperature within the operational limits established for the airplane, at which the steady gradient of climb is not less 1.2 percent at an altitude 1,000 feet above the takeoff surface, with the airplane in the en route configuration, the critical engine inoperative, the remaining engine at the maximum continuous power or thrust, and the most unfavorable center of gravity.

7\. *Landing.* (a) The landing field length described in paragraph (b) of this section must be determined for standard atmosphere at each weight and altitude within the operational limits established by the applicant.

\(b\) The landing field length is equal to the landing distance determined under FAR 23.75(a) divided by a factor of 0.6 for the destination airport and 0.7 for the alternate airport. Instead of the gliding approach specified in FAR 23.75(a)(1), the landing may be preceded by a steady approach down to the 50-foot height at a gradient of descent not greater than 5.2 percent (3°) at a calibrated airspeed not less than 1.3*VS*1.

### Trim

8\. *Trim.* (a) *Lateral and directional trim.* The airplane must maintain lateral and directional trim in level flight at a speed of *VH* or *VMO*/*MMO,* whichever is lower, with landing gear and wing flaps retracted.

\(b\) *Longitudinal trim.* The airplane must maintain longitudinal trim during the following conditions, except that it need not maintain trim at a speed greater than *VMO*/*MMO*:

\(1\) In the approach conditions specified in FAR 23.161(c) (3) through (5), except that instead of the speeds specified in those paragraphs, trim must be maintained with a stick force of not more than 10 pounds down to a speed used in showing compliance with section 7 or 1.4*VS*1 whichever is lower.

\(2\) In level flight at any speed from *VH* or *VMO*/*MMO*, whichever is lower, to either *Vx* or 1.4*VS*1, with the landing gear and wing flaps retracted.

### Stability

9\. *Static longitudinal stability.* (a) In showing compliance with FAR 23.175(b) and with paragraph (b) of this section, the airspeed must return to within ±71⁄2 percent of the trim speed.

\(b\) *Cruise stability.* The stick force curve must have a stable slope for a speed range of ±50 knots from the trim speed except that the speeds need not exceed *VFC*/*MFC* or be less than 1.4*VS*1. This speed range will be considered to begin at the outer extremes of the friction band and the stick force may not exceed 50 pounds with—

\(1\) Landing gear retracted;

\(2\) Wing flaps retracted;

\(3\) The maximum cruising power as selected by the applicant as an operating limitation for turbine engines or 75 percent of maximum continuous power for reciprocating engines except that the power need not exceed that required at *VMO*/*MMO*;

\(5\) The airplane trimmed for level flight with the power specified in paragraph (3) of this paragraph.

*VFC*/*MFC* may not be less than a speed midway between *VMO*/*MMO* and *VDF*/*MDF,* except that, for altitudes where Mach number is the limiting factor, *MFC* need not exceed the Mach number at which effective speed warning occurs.

\(c\) *Climb stability (turbopropeller powered airplanes only).* In showing compliance with FAR 23.175(a), an applicant must, instead of the power specified in FAR 23.175(a)(4), use the maximum power or thrust selected by the applicant as an operating limitation for use during climb at the best rate of climb speed, except that the speed need not be less than 1.4*VS*1.

### Stalls

10\. *Stall warning.* If artificial stall warning is required to comply with FAR 23.207, the warning device must give clearly distinguishable indications under expected conditions of flight. The use of a visual warning device that requires the attention of the crew within the cockpit is not acceptable by itself.

### Control Systems

11\. *Electric trim tabs.* The airplane must meet FAR 23.677 and in addition it must be shown that the airplane is safely controllable and that a pilot can perform all the maneuvers and operations necessary to effect a safe landing following any probable electric trim tab runaway which might be reasonably expected in service allowing for appropriate time delay after pilot recognition of the runaway. This demonstration must be conducted at the critical airplane weights and center of gravity positions.

### Instruments: Installation

12\. *Arrangement and visibility.* Each instrument must meet FAR 23.1321 and in addition:

\(a\) Each flight, navigation, and powerplant instrument for use by any pilot must be plainly visible to the pilot from the pilot's station with the minimum practicable deviation from the pilot's normal position and line of vision when the pilot is looking forward along the flight path.

\(b\) The flight instruments required by FAR 23.1303 and by the applicable operating rules must be grouped on the instrument panel and centered as nearly as practicable about the vertical plane of each pilot's forward vision. In addition—

\(b\) The airspeed indicating system must be calibrated to determine the system error, i.e., the relation between IAS and CAS, in flight and during the accelerate-takeoff ground run. The ground run calibration must be obtained between 0.8 of the minimum value of *V*1 and 1.2 times the maximum value of *V*1, considering the approved ranges of altitude and weight. The ground run calibration is determined assuming an engine failure at the minimum value of *V*1.

\(c\) The airspeed error of the installation excluding the instrument calibration error, must not exceed 3 percent or 5 knots whichever is greater, throughout the speed range from *VMO* to 1.3*VS*1 with flaps retracted and from 1.3*VSO* to *VFE* with flaps in the landing position.

\(a\) The maximum operating limit speed must not exceed the design cruising speed *VC* and must be sufficiently below *VD*/*MD* or *VDF*/*MDF* to make it highly improbable that the latter speeds will be inadvertently exceeded in flight.

\(b\) The speed *VMO* must not exceed 0.8*VD*/*MD* or 0.8*VDF*/*MDF* unless flight demonstrations involving upsets as specified by the Administrator indicates a lower speed margin will not result in speeds exceeding *VD*/*MD* or *VDF.* Atmospheric variations, horizontal gusts, system and equipment errors, and airframe production variations are taken into account.

16\. *Minimum flight crew.* In addition to meeting FAR 23.1523, the applicant must establish the minimum number and type of qualified flight crew personnel sufficient for safe operation of the airplane considering—

\(a\) Each kind of operation for which the applicant desires approval;

### Airframe Requirements

### Flight Loads

24\. *Engine torque.* (a) Each turbopropeller engine mount and its supporting structure must be designed for the torque effects of:

\(1\) The conditions in FAR 23.361(a).

\(2\) The limit engine torque corresponding to takeoff power and propeller speed multiplied by a factor accounting for propeller control system malfunction, including quick feathering action, simultaneously with 1*g* level flight loads. In the absence of a ration- al analysis, a factor of 1.6 must be used.

\(b\) The limit torque is obtained by multiplying the mean torque by a factor of 1.25.

25\. *Turbine engine gyroscopic loads.* Each turbopropeller engine mount and its supporting structure must be designed for the gyroscopic loads that result, with the engines at maximum continuous r.p.m., under either—

26\. *Unsymmetrical loads due to engine failure.* (a) Turbopropeller powered airplanes must be designed for the unsymmet- rical loads resulting from the failure of the critical engine including the following conditions in combination with a single malfunction of the propeller drag limiting system, considering the probable pilot corrective action on the flight controls:

\(1\) At speeds between *Vmo* and *VD,* the loads resulting from power failure because of fuel flow interruption are considered to be limit loads.

\(2\) At speeds between *Vmo* and *Vc,* the loads resulting from the disconnection of the engine compressor from the turbine or from loss of the turbine blades are considered to be ultimate loads.

\(3\) The time history of the thrust decay and drag buildup occurring as a result of the prescribed engine failures must be substantiated by test or other data applicable to the particular engine-propeller combination.

\(4\) The timing and magnitude of the probable pilot corrective action must be conserv- atively estimated, considering the characteristics of the particular engine-propeller-airplane combination.

\(b\) Pilot corrective action may be assumed to be initiated at the time maximum yawing velocity is reached, but not earlier than 2 seconds after the engine failure. The magnitude of the corrective action may be based on the control forces in FAR 23.397 except that lower forces may be assumed where it is shown by analysis or test that these forces can control the yaw and roll resulting from the prescribed engine failure conditions.

### Ground Loads

27\. *Dual wheel landing gear units.* Each dual wheel landing gear unit and its supporting structure must be shown to comply with the following:

\(a\) *Pivoting.* The airplane must be assumed to pivot about one side of the main gear with the brakes on that side locked. The limit vertical load factor must be 1.0 and the coefficient of friction 0.8. This condition need apply only to the main gear and its supporting structure.

\(c\) *Flat tire.* (1) Sixty percent of the loads in FAR 23.471 through FAR 23.483 must be applied to either wheel in a unit.

\(2\) Sixty percent of the limit drag and side loads and 100 percent of the limit vertical load established under FARs 23.493 and 23.485 must be applied to either wheel in a unit except that the vertical load need not exceed the maximum vertical load in paragraph (c)(1) of this section.

### Fatigue Evaluation

28\. *Fatigue evaluation of wing and associated structure.* Unless it is shown that the structure, operating stress levels, materials and expected use are comparable from a fatigue standpoint to a similar design which has had substantial satisfactory service experience, the strength, detail design, and the fabrication of those parts of the wing, wing carrythrough, and attaching structure whose failure would be catastrophic must be evaluated under either—

\(a\) A fatigue strength investigation in which the structure is shown by analysis, tests, or both to be able to withstand the repeated loads of variable magnitude expected in service; or

\(b\) A fail-safe strength investigation in which it is shown by analysis, tests, or both that catastrophic failure of the structure is not probable after fatigue, or obvious partial failure, of a principal structural element, and that the remaining structure is able to withstand a static ultimate load factor of 75 percent of the critical limit load factor at *VC.* These loads must be multiplied by a factor of 1.15 unless the dynamic effects of failure under static load are otherwise considered.

### Design and Construction

29\. *Flutter.* For multiengine turbopropeller powered airplanes, a dynamic evaluation must be made and must include—

\(a\) The significant elastic, inertia, and aerodynamic forces associated with the rotations and displacements of the plane of the propeller; and

\(b\) Engine-propeller-nacelle stiffness and damping variations appropriate to the particular configuration.

### Landing Gear

### Propulsion

### General

36\. *Vibration characteristics.* For turbopropeller powered airplanes, the engine installation must not result in vibration characteristics of the engine exceeding those established during the type certification of the engine.

37\. *In flight restarting of engine.* If the engine on turbopropeller powered airplanes cannot be restarted at the maximum cruise altitude, a determination must be made of the altitude below which restarts can be consistently accomplished. Restart information must be provided in the Airplane Flight Manual.

38\. *Engines.* (a) *For turbopropeller powered airplanes.* The engine installation must comply with the following:

\(1\) *Engine isolation.* The powerplants must be arranged and isolated from each other to allow operation, in at least one configuration, so that the failure or malfunction of any engine, or of any system that can affect the engine, will not—

\(i\) Prevent the continued safe operation of the remaining engines; or

\(ii\) Require immediate action by any crewmember for continued safe operation.

\(2\) *Control of engine rotation.* There must be a means to individually stop and restart the rotation of any engine in flight except that engine rotation need not be stopped if continued rotation could not jeopardize the safety of the airplane. Each component of the stopping and restarting system on the engine side of the firewall, and that might be exposed to fire, must be at least fire resistant. If hydraulic propeller feathering systems are used for this purpose, the feathering lines must be at least fire resistant under the operating conditions that may be expected to exist during feathering.

\(3\) *Engine speed and gas temperature control devices.* The powerplant systems associated with engine control devices, systems, and instrumentation must provide reasonable assurance that those engine operating limitations that adversely affect turbine rotor structural integrity will not be exceeded in service.

\(b\) *For reciprocating engine powered airplanes.* To provide engine isolation, the powerplants must be arranged and isolated from each other to allow operation, in at least one configuration, so that the failure or malfunction of any engine, or of any system that can affect that engine, will not—

\(1\) Prevent the continued safe operation of the remaining engines; or

\(2\) Require immediate action by any crewmember for continued safe operation.

39\. *Turbopropeller reversing systems.* (a) Turbopropeller reversing systems intended for ground operation must be designed so that no single failure or malfunction of the system will result in unwanted reverse thrust under any expected operating condition. Failure of structural elements need not be considered if the probability of this kind of failure is extremely remote.

\(b\) Turbopropeller reversing systems intended for in flight use must be designed so that no unsafe condition will result during normal operation of the system, or from any failure (or reasonably likely combination of failures) of the reversing system, under any anticipated condition of operation of the airplane. Failure of structural elements need not be considered if the probability of this kind of failure is extremely remote.

\(c\) Compliance with this section may be shown by failure analysis, testing, or both for propeller systems that allow propeller blades to move from the flight low-pitch position to a position that is substantially less than that at the normal flight low-pitch stop position. The analysis may include or be supported by the analysis made to show compliance with the type certification of the propeller and associated installation components. Credit will be given for pertinent analysis and testing completed by the engine and propeller manufacturers.

40\. *Turbopropeller drag-limiting systems.* Turbopropeller drag-limiting systems must be designed so that no single failure or malfunction of any of the systems during normal or emergency operation results in propeller drag in excess of that for which the airplane was designed. Failure of structural elements of the drag-limiting systems need not be considered if the probability of this kind of failure is extremely remote.

41\. *Turbine engine powerplant operating characteristics.* For turbopropeller powered airplanes, the turbine engine powerplant operating characteristics must be investigated in flight to determine that no adverse characteristics (such as stall, surge, or flameout) are present to a hazardous degree, during normal and emergency operation within the range of operating limitations of the airplane and of the engine.

42\. *Fuel flow.* (a) For turbopropeller powered airplanes—

\(1\) The fuel system must provide for continuous supply of fuel to the engines for normal operation without interruption due to depletion of fuel in any tank other than the main tank; and

\(b\) For reciprocating engine powered airplanes, it is acceptable for the fuel flow rate for each pump system (main and reserve supply) to be 125 percent of the takeoff fuel consumption of the engine.

### Fuel System Components

43\. *Fuel pumps.* For turbopropeller powered airplanes, a reliable and independent power source must be provided for each pump used with turbine engines which do not have provisions for mechanically driving the main pumps. It must be demonstrated that the pump installations provide a reliability and durability equivalent to that in FAR 23.991(a).

44\. *Fuel strainer or filter.* For turbopropeller powered airplanes, the following apply:

\(a\) There must be a fuel strainer or filter between the tank outlet and the fuel metering device of the engine. In addition, the fuel strainer or filter must be—

\(1\) Between the tank outlet and the engine-driven positive displacement pump inlet, if there is an engine-driven positive displacement pump;

\(2\) Accessible for drainage and cleaning and, for the strainer screen, easily removable; and

\(3\) Mounted so that its weight is not supported by the connecting lines or by the inlet or outlet connections of the strainer or filter itself.

\(b\) Unless there are means in the fuel system to prevent the accumulation of ice on the filter, there must be means to automatically maintain the fuel-flow if ice-clogging of the filter occurs; and

\(c\) The fuel strainer or filter must be of adequate capacity (for operating limitations established to ensure proper service) and of appropriate mesh to insure proper engine operation, with the fuel contaminated to a degree (for particle size and density) that can be reasonably expected in service. The degree of fuel filtering may not be less than that established for the engine type certification.

45\. *Lightning strike protection.* Protection must be provided against the ignition of flammable vapors in the fuel vent system due to lightning strikes.

### Cooling

46\. *Cooling test procedures for turbopropeller powered airplanes.* (a) Turbopropeller powered airplanes must be shown to comply with FAR 23.1041 during takeoff, climb, en route, and landing stages of flight that correspond to the applicable performance requirements. The cooling tests must be conducted with the airplane in the configuration, and operating under the conditions that are critical relative to cooling during each stage of flight. For the cooling tests a temperature is “stabilized” when its rate of change is less than 2 °F. per minute.

\(b\) Temperatures must be stabilized under the conditions from which entry is made into each stage of flight being investigated unless the entry condition is not one during which component and engine fluid temperatures would stabilize, in which case, operation through the full entry condition must be conducted before entry into the stage of flight being investigated to allow temperatures to reach their natural levels at the time of entry. The takeoff cooling test must be preceded by a period during which the powerplant component and engine fluid temperatures are stabilized with the engines at ground idle.

\(c\) Cooling tests for each stage of flight must be continued until—

\(1\) The component and engine fluid temperatures stabilize;

\(2\) The stage of flight is completed; or

\(3\) An operating limitation is reached.

48\. *Induction system icing protection.* For turbopropeller powered airplanes, each turbine engine must be able to operate throughout its flight power range without adverse effect on engine operation or serious loss of power or thrust, under the icing conditions specified in appendix C of [[Volume 1/C Aircraft/0025 Airworthiness standards  transport category airplanes.md|part 25 of this chapter]]. In addition, there must be means to indicate to appropriate flight crewmembers the functioning of the powerplant ice protection system.

49\. *Turbine engine bleed air systems.* Turbine engine bleed air systems of turbopropeller powered airplanes must be investigated to determine—

\(a\) That no hazard to the airplane will result if a duct rupture occurs. This condition must consider that a failure of the duct can occur anywhere between the engine port and the airplane bleed service; and

\(b\) That, if the bleed air system is used for direct cabin pressurization, it is not possible for hazardous contamination of the cabin air system to occur in event of lubrication system failure.

### Exhaust System

50\. *Exhaust system drains.* Turbopropeller engine exhaust systems having low spots or pockets must incorporate drains at those locations. These drains must discharge clear of the airplane in normal and ground attitudes to prevent the accumulation of fuel after the failure of an attempted engine start.

### Powerplant Controls and Accessories

51\. *Engine controls.* If throttles or power levers for turbopropeller powered airplanes are such that any position of these controls will reduce the fuel flow to the engine(s) below that necessary for satisfactory and safe idle operation of the engine while the airplane is in flight, a means must be provided to prevent inadvertent movement of the control into this position. The means provided must incorporate a positive lock or stop at this idle position and must require a separate and distinct operation by the crew to displace the control from the normal engine operating range.

52\. *Reverse thrust controls.* For turbopropeller powered airplanes, the propeller reverse thrust controls must have a means to prevent their inadvertent operation. The means must have a positive lock or stop at the idle position and must require a separate and distinct operation by the crew to displace the control from the flight regime.

53\. *Engine ignition systems.* Each turbopropeller airplane ignition system must be considered an essential electrical load.

54\. *Powerplant accessories.* The powerplant accessories must meet FAR 23.1163, and if the continued rotation of any accessory remotely driven by the engine is hazardous when malfunctioning occurs, there must be means to prevent rotation without interfering with the continued operation of the engine.

### Powerplant Fire Protection

57\. *Flammable fluid fire protection.* If flammable fluids or vapors might be liberated by the leakage of fluid systems in areas other than engine compartments, there must be means to—

\(a\) Prevent the ignition of those fluids or vapors by any other equipment; or

\(b\) Control any fire resulting from that ignition.

<sup>2</sup>Per cent of full range.

<sup>3</sup>For airplanes that can demonstrate the capability of deriving either the control input on control movement (one from the other) for all modes of operation and flight regimes, the “or” applies. For airplanes with non-mechanical control systems (fly-by-wire) the “and” applies. In airplanes with split surfaces, suitable combination of inputs is acceptable in lieu of recording each surface separately.

### Appendix G to Part 135—Extended Operations (ETOPS)

G135.1   *Definitions.*

G135.1.1   *Adequate Airport* means an airport that an airplane operator may list with approval from the FAA because that airport meets the landing limitations of [[Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft.md#§135.385   Large transport category airplanes: Turbine engine powered: Landing limitations: Destination airports.|§135.385]] or is a military airport that is active and operational.

G135.1.2   *ETOPS Alternate Airport* means an adequate airport that is designated in a dispatch or flight release for use in the event of a diversion during ETOPS. This definition applies to flight planning and does not in any way limit the authority of the pilot in command during flight.

G135.1.3   *ETOPS Entry Point* means the first point on the route of an ETOPS flight, determined using a one-engine inoperative cruise speed under standard conditions in still air, that is more than 180 minutes from an adequate airport.

G135.1.4   *ETOPS Qualified Person* means a person, performing maintenance for the certificate holder, who has satisfactorily completed the certificate holder's ETOPS training program.

G135.2   *Requirements.*

G135.2.1   *General.* After August 13, 2008, no certificate holder may operate an airplane, other than an all-cargo airplane with more than two engines, outside the continental United States more than 180 minutes flying time (at the one-engine-inoperative cruise speed under standard conditions in still air) from an airport described in [[Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft.md#§135.364   Maximum flying time outside the United States.|§135.364]] unless—

\(a\) The certificate holder receives ETOPS approval from the FAA;

\(b\) The operation is conducted in a multi-engine transport category turbine-powered airplane;

\(c\) The operation is planned to be no more than 240 minutes flying time (at the one engine inoperative cruise speed under standard conditions in still air) from an airport described in [[Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft.md#§135.364   Maximum flying time outside the United States.|§135.364]]; and

\(d\) The certificate holder meets the requirements of this appendix.

G135.2.2 *Required certificate holder experience prior to conducting ETOPS.*

Before applying for ETOPS approval, the certificate holder must have at least 12 months experience conducting international operations (excluding Canada and Mexico) with multi-engine transport category turbine-engine powered airplanes. The certificate holder may consider the following experience as international operations:

\(a\) No person may allow a flight to continue beyond its ETOPS Entry Point unless—

\(1\) The weather conditions at each ETOPS Alternate Airport are forecast to be at or above the operating minima in the certificate holder's operations specifications for that airport when it might be used (from the earliest to the latest possible landing time), and

\(3\) All ETOPS Alternate Airports within the authorized ETOPS maximum diversion time are reviewed for any changes in conditions that have occurred since dispatch.

\(b\) In the event that an operator cannot comply with paragraph G135.2.5(a)(1) of this appendix for a specific airport, another ETOPS Alternate Airport must be substituted within the maximum ETOPS diversion time that could be authorized for that flight with weather conditions at or above operating minima.

\(c\) Pilots must plan and conduct ETOPS under instrument flight rules.

\(d\) *Time-Limited Systems.* (1) Except as provided in paragraph G135.2.5(d)(3) of this appendix, the time required to fly the distance to each ETOPS Alternate Airport (at the all-engines-operating cruise speed, corrected for wind and temperature) may not exceed the time specified in the Airplane Flight Manual for the airplane's most limiting fire suppression system time required by regulation for any cargo or baggage compartments (if installed), minus 15 minutes.

\(2\) Except as provided in G135.2.5(d)(3) of this appendix, the time required to fly the distance to each ETOPS Alternate Airport (at the approved one-engine-inoperative cruise speed, corrected for wind and temperature) may not exceed the time specified in the Airplane Flight Manual for the airplane's most time limited system time (other than the airplane's most limiting fire suppression system time required by regulation for any cargo or baggage compartments), minus 15 minutes.

G135.2.7   *Fuel Requirements.* No person may dispatch or release for flight an ETOPS flight unless, considering wind and other weather conditions expected, it has the fuel otherwise required by this part and enough fuel to satisfy each of the following requirements:

\(a\) *Fuel to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport.* (1) Fuel to account for rapid decompression and engine failure. The airplane must carry the greater of the following amounts of fuel:

\(i\) Fuel sufficient to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport assuming a rapid decompression at the most critical point followed by descent to a safe altitude in compliance with the oxygen supply requirements of [[Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft.md#§135.157   Oxygen equipment requirements.|§135.157]];

\(ii\) Fuel sufficient to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport (at the one-engine-inoperative cruise speed under standard conditions in still air) assuming a rapid decompression and a simultaneous engine failure at the most critical point followed by descent to a safe altitude in compliance with the oxygen requirements of [[Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft.md#§135.157   Oxygen equipment requirements.|§135.157]]; or

\(iii\) Fuel sufficient to fly to an ETOPS Alternate Airport (at the one-engine-inoperative cruise speed under standard conditions in still air) assuming an engine failure at the most critical point followed by descent to the one engine inoperative cruise altitude.

\(2\) Fuel to account for errors in wind forecasting. In calculating the amount of fuel required by paragraph G135.2.7(a)(1) of this appendix, the certificate holder must increase the actual forecast wind speed by 5% (resulting in an increase in headwind or a decrease in tailwind) to account for any potential errors in wind forecasting. If a certificate holder is not using the actual forecast wind based on a wind model accepted by the FAA, the airplane must carry additional fuel equal to 5% of the fuel required by paragraph G135.2.7(a) of this appendix, as reserve fuel to allow for errors in wind data.

\(3\) Fuel to account for icing. In calculating the amount of fuel required by paragraph G135.2.7(a)(1) of this appendix, (after completing the wind calculation in G135.2.7(a)(2) of this appendix), the certificate holder must ensure that the airplane carries the greater of the following amounts of fuel in anticipation of possible icing during the diversion:

\(i\) Fuel that would be burned as a result of airframe icing during 10 percent of the time icing is forecast (including the fuel used by engine and wing anti-ice during this period).

\(ii\) Fuel that would be used for engine anti-ice, and if appropriate wing anti-ice, for the entire time during which icing is forecast.

\(4\) Fuel to account for engine deterioration. In calculating the amount of fuel required by paragraph G135.2.7(a)(1) of this appendix (after completing the wind calculation in paragraph G135.2.7(a)(2) of this appendix), the certificate holder must ensure the airplane also carries fuel equal to 5% of the fuel specified above, to account for deterioration in cruise fuel burn performance unless the certificate holder has a program to monitor airplane in-service deterioration to cruise fuel burn performance.

\(b\) *Fuel to account for holding, approach, and landing.* In addition to the fuel required by paragraph G135.2.7 (a) of this appendix, the airplane must carry fuel sufficient to hold at 1500 feet above field elevation for 15 minutes upon reaching the ETOPS Alternate Airport and then conduct an instrument approach and land.

\(c\) *Fuel to account for APU use.* If an APU is a required power source, the certificate holder must account for its fuel consumption during the appropriate phases of flight.

G135.2.8 *Maintenance Program Requirements.* In order to conduct an ETOPS flight under [[Volume 3/G Air carriers and operators for compensation or hire  certification and operations/0135 Operating requirements  commuter and on demand operations and rules governing persons on board such aircraft.md#§135.364   Maximum flying time outside the United States.|§135.364]], each certificate holder must develop and comply with the ETOPS maintenance program as authorized in the certificate holder's operations specifications for each two-engine airplane-engine combination used in ETOPS. This provision does not apply to operations using an airplane with more than two engines. The certificate holder must develop this ETOPS maintenance program to supplement the maintenance program currently approved for the operator. This ETOPS maintenance program must include the following elements:

\(d\) *Verification program.* The certificate holder must develop a program for the resolution of discrepancies that will ensure the effectiveness of maintenance actions taken on ETOPS Significant Systems. The verification program must identify potential problems and verify satisfactory corrective action. The verification program must include ground verification and in-flight verification policy and procedures. The certificate holder must establish procedures to clearly indicate who is going to initiate the verification action and what action is necessary. The verification action may be performed on an ETOPS revenue flight provided the verification action is documented as satisfactorily completed upon reaching the ETOPS entry point.

\(e\) *Task identification.* The certificate holder must identify all ETOPS-specific tasks. An ETOPS qualified person must accomplish and certify by signature that the ETOPS-specific task has been completed.

\(2\) Investigate common cause effects or systemic errors and submit the findings to the responsible Flight Standards office within 30 days.

\(j\) *Engine condition monitoring.* (1) The certificate holder must establish an engine-condition monitoring program to detect deterioration at an early stage and to allow for corrective action before safe operation is affected.

\(2\) This program must describe the parameters to be monitored, the method of data collection, the method of analyzing data, and the process for taking corrective action.

\(3\) The program must ensure that engine limit margins are maintained so that a prolonged engine-inoperative diversion may be conducted at approved power levels and in all expected environmental conditions without exceeding approved engine limits. This includes approved limits for items such as rotor speeds and exhaust gas temperatures.

\(k\) *Oil consumption monitoring.* The certificate holder must develop an engine oil consumption monitoring program to ensure that there is enough oil to complete each ETOPS flight. APU oil consumption must be included if an APU is required for ETOPS. The operator's consumption limit may not exceed the manufacturer's recommendation.
