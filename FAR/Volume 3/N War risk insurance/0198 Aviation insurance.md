### §198.1   Eligibility of aircraft operation for insurance.

An aircraft operation is eligible for insurance if—

(a) The President of the United States has determined that the continuation of that aircraft operation is necessary to carry out the foreign policy of the United States;

(b) The aircraft operation is—

(1) In foreign air commerce or between two or more places all of which are outside the United States if insurance with premium is sought; or

(2) In domestic or foreign air commerce, or between two or more places all of which are outside the United States if insurance without premium is sought; and

(c) The Administrator finds that commercial insurance against loss or damage arising out of any risk from the aircraft operation cannot be obtained on reasonable terms from an insurance carrier.

### §198.3   Basis of insurance.

(a) Premium insurance may be issued by the FAA is the requirements of §198.1 (a), (b)(1) and (c) are met.

(b) Subject to §198.9(c), standby insurance without premium may be issued by the FAA if all of the following conditions have been met:

(1) A department, agency, or instrumentality of the U.S. Government seeks performance of air services operations, pursuant to a contract of the department, agency, or instrumentality; or transportation of military forces or materiel on behalf of the United States, pursuant to an agreement between the United States and a foreign government.

(2) Such department, agency, or instrumentality of the U.S. Government has agreed in writing to indemnify the Secretary of Transportation against all losses covered by such insurance. Such an agreement, when countersigned by the President, constitutes a determination that the continuation of that aircraft operation is necessary to carry out the foreign policy of the United States.

(3) A current copy of the aircraft operator's applicable commercial insurance policy or policies is on file with the FAA, including every endorsement making a material change to the policy. Updated copies of these policies must be provided upon each renewal of the commercial policy. Every subsequent material change by endorsement must be promptly provided to the FAA.

(c) Insurance is activated, placing the insurance in full force, as specified by the FAA's written notification to the operator and remains in force until such time as either of the following occurs:

(1) The requirements in §198.1 are no longer met; or

(2) In the case of non-premium insurance, an aircraft operation is no longer performed under contract to a department, agency, or instrumentality of the U.S. Government; or pursuant to an agreement between the United States and a foreign government; or the Administrator finds that commercial insurance can now be obtained on reasonable terms.

(d) Insurance policies revert to standby status upon written notification by the FAA to the aircraft operator. A policy will remain in standby status until either—

(1) The insurance is activated by written notice; or

(2) The policy is canceled.

### §198.5   Types of insurance coverage available.

Application may be made for insurance against loss or damage to the following persons, property, or interests:

(a) Aircraft, or insurable items of an aircraft, engaged in eligible operations under §198.1.

(b) Any individual employed or transported on the aircraft referred to in paragraph (a) of this section.

(c) The baggage of persons referred to in paragraph (b) of this section.

(d) Property transported, or to be transported, on the aircraft referred to in paragraph (a) of this section.

(e) Statutory or contractual obligations, or any other liability, of the aircraft referred to in paragraph (a) of this section or of its owner or operator, of the nature customarily covered by insurance.

### §198.7   Amount of insurance coverage available.

(a) For each aircraft or insurable item, the amount insured may not exceed the amount for which the applicant has otherwise insured or self-insured the aircraft or insurable item against damage or liability arising from any risk. In the case of hull insurance, the amount insured may not exceed the reasonable value of the aircraft as determined by the FAA or its designated agent.

(b) Policies issued without premium may be revised from time to time by the FAA with notice to the insured, to add aircraft or insurable items or to amend amounts of coverage if the insured has changed the amount by which it has otherwise insured or self-insured the aircraft or itself.

### §198.9   Applicant for insurance.

(a) Application for premium or non-premium insurance must be made in accordance with the applicable form supplied by the FAA.

(b) Each applicant for insurance with the premium under this part must submit to the FAA with its application a letter describing in detail the operations in which the aircraft is or will be engaged and stating the type of insurance coverage being sought and the reason it is being sought. The applicant must also submit any other information deemed pertinent by the FAA.

(c) Each applicant for premium or non-premium insurance must, upon request by the FAA, submit to the FAA evidence that commercial insurance is not available on reasonable terms for each flight or ground operation for which insurance is sought. Each aircraft operator who has a standby non-premium insurance policy must, upon request by the FAA, submit evidence to the FAA that commercial insurance is not available on reasonable terms before the FAA activates that policy. The adequacy of the evidence submitted is determined solely by the FAA.

(d) The standby non-premium policy issued to the aircraft operator does not provide actual coverage until formally activated by the FAA.

### §198.11   Change in status of aircraft.

In the event of sale, lease, confiscation, requisition, total loss, or other change in the status of an aircraft or insurable items covered by insurance under this part, the insured party must notify the office administering the Aviation Insurance Program before, or as soon as practicable after, the change in status.

### §198.13   Premium insurance—payment of premiums.

The insured must pay the premium for insurance issued under this part within the stated period after receipt of notice that premium payment is due and in accordance with the provisions of the applicable FAA insurance policy. Premiums must be sent to the FAA, and made payable to the FAA.

### §198.15   Non-premium insurance—payment of registration binders.

(a) The binder for initial registration is $575 for each aircraft or insurable item. This binder is adjusted not more frequently than annually based on changes in the Consumer Price Index of All Urban Consumers published by the Secretary of Labor.

(b) An application for non-premium insurance must be accompanied by the proper binder, payable to the FAA. A binder is not returnable unless the application is rejected.

(c) Requests made after issuance of a non-premium policy for the addition of an aircraft or insurable item must be accompanied by the binder for each aircraft and insurable item.

(d) When an operator acquires an aircraft or insurable item that was previously covered under an active or standby policy, the new operator must register that aircraft or item on its policy and pay the binder for each aircraft and insurable item.

### §198.17   Ground support and other coverage.

An aircraft operator may apply for insurance to cover any risks arising from the provision of goods or services directly supporting the operation of an aircraft that meets the requirements of §198.3(b).
