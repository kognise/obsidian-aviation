## Subpart A—General Requirements

### §151.1   Applicability.

This part prescribes the policies and procedures for administering the Federal-aid Airport Program under the Federal Airport Act, as amended (49 U.S.C. 1101 *et seq.*).

\[Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12349, Dec. 13, 1962\]

### §151.3   National Airport Plan.

\(a\) Under the Federal Airport Act, the FAA prepares each year a “National Airport Plan” for developing public airports in the United States, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, and Guam. In terms of general location and type of development, the National Airport Plan specifies the maximum limits of airport development that is necessary to provide a system of public airports adequate to anticipate and meet the needs of civil aeronautics.

\(b\) If, within the forecast period, an airport will have a substantial aeronautical necessity, it may be included in the National Airport Plan. Only work on an airport included in the current Plan is eligible for inclusion in the Federal-aid Airport Program to be undertaken within currently available appropriations and authorizations. However, the inclusion of an airport in the National Airport Plan does not commit the United States to include it in the Federal-aid Airport Program. In addition, the local community concerned is not required to proceed with planning or development of an airport included in the National Airport Plan.

\[Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8039, June 23, 1965\]

### §151.5   General policies.

\(a\) *Airport layout plan.* As used in this part, “airport layout plan” means the basic plan for the layout of an eligible airport that shows, as a minimum—

\(1\) The present boundaries of the airport and of the offsite areas that the sponsor owns or controls for airport purposes, and of their proposed additions;

\(2\) The location and nature of existing and proposed airport facilities (such as runways, taxiways, aprons, terminal buildings, hangars, and roads) and of their proposed modifications and extensions; and

\(3\) The location of existing and proposed non-aviation areas, and of their existing improvements.

\(b\) *Safe, useful, and usable unit.* Except as provided in paragraph (d) of this section, each advance planning and engineering proposal or airport development project must provide for the planning or development of—

\(1\) An airport or unit of an airport that is safe, useful, and usable; or

\(2\) An additional facility that increases the safety, usefulness, or usability of an airport.

\(c\) *National defense needs.* The needs of national defense are fully considered in administering the Federal-aid Airport Program. However, approval of an advance planning and engineering proposal or a project application is limited to planning or airport development necessary for civil aviation.

\(d\) *Stage development.* In any case in which airport development can be accomplished more economically under stage construction, federal funds may be programmed in advance for the development over two or more years under two or more grant agreements. In such a case, the FAA makes a tentative allocation of funds for both the current and future fiscal years, rather than allocating the entire federal share in one fiscal year. A grant agreement is made only during the fiscal year in which funds are authorized to be obligated. Advance planning and engineering grants are not made under this paragraph.

\[Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8039, June 23, 1965\]

### §151.7   Grants of funds: General policies.

\(a\) *Compliance with sponsorship requirements.* The FAA authorizes the expenditure of funds under the Federal-aid Airport Program for airport planning and engineering or for airport development only if the Administrator is satisfied that the sponsor has met or will meet the requirements established by existing and proposed agreements with the United States with respect to any airport that the sponsor owns or controls.

\(1\) Agreements with the United States to which this requirement of compliance applies include—

\(i\) Any grant agreement made under the Federal-aid Airport Program;

\(ii\) Any covenant in a conveyance under section 16 of the Federal Airport Act;

\(iii\) Any covenant in a conveyance of surplus airport property either under section 13(g) of the Surplus Property Act (50 U.S.C. App. 1622(g)) or under Regulation 16 of the War Assets Administration; and

\(iv\) Any AP-4 agreement made under the terminated Development Landing Areas National Defense Program and the Development Civil Landing Areas Program.

\(2\) If it appears that a sponsor has failed to comply with a requirement of an agreement with the United States with respect to an airport, the FAA notifies him of this fact and affords him an opportunity to submit materials to refute the allegation of noncompliance or to achieve compliance.

\(3\) If a project is otherwise eligible under the Federal-aid Airport Program, a grant may be made to a sponsor who has not complied with an agreement if the sponsor shows—

\(i\) That the noncompliance is caused by factors beyond his control; or

\(ii\) That the following circumstances exist:

(*a*) The noncompliance consisted of a failure, through mistake or ignorance, to perform minor conditions in old agreements with the Federal Government; and

(*b*) The sponsor is taking reasonable action promptly to correct the deficiency or the deficiency relates to an obligation that is no longer required for the safe and efficient use of the airport under existing law and policy.

\(b\) *Small proposals and projects.* Unless there is otherwise a special need for U.S. participation, the FAA includes an advance planning and engineering proposal or an airport development project in the Federal-aid Airport Program only if—

\(1\) The advance planning and engineering proposal involves more than \$1,000 in United States funds; and

\(2\) The project application involves more than \$5,000 in U.S. funds.

\(c\) *Previously obligated work.* Unless the Administrator specifically authorizes it, no advance planning and engineering proposal or project application may include any planning, engineering, or construction work included in a prior agreement with the United States obligating the sponsor or any other non-U.S. public agency to do the work, and entitling the sponsor or any other non-United States public agency to payment of U.S. funds for all or part of the work.

(Secs. 1-15, 17-21, 60 Stat. 170, 49 U.S.C. 1120)

\[Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8039, June 23, 1965, as amended by Amdt. 151-17, 31 FR 16524, Dec. 28, 1966; Amdt. 151-19, 32 FR 9220, June 29, 1967\]

### §151.9   Runway clear zones: General.

\(a\) Whenever funds are allocated for developing new runways or landing strips, or to improve or repair existing runways, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire, runway clear zones. Exceptions are considered (on the basis of a full statement of facts by the sponsor) upon a showing of uneconomical acquisition costs, or lack of necessity for the acquisition.

\(b\) For the purpose of this part, a runway clear zone is an area at ground level which begins at the end of each primary surface defined in [[Volume 2/E Airspace/0077 Safe, efficient use, and preservation of the navigable airspace.md#§77.27   Initiation of studies.|§77.27]](a) and extends with the width of each approach surface defined in [[Volume 2/E Airspace/0077 Safe, efficient use, and preservation of the navigable airspace.md#§77.27   Initiation of studies.|§77.27]] (b) and (c), to terminate directly below each approach surface slope at the point, or points, where the slope reaches a height of 50 feet above the elevation of the runway or 50 feet above the terrain at the outer extremity of the clear zone, whichever distance is shorter.

\(c\) For the purposes of this section, an airport operator or owner is considered to have an adequate property interest if it has an easement (or a covenant running with the land) giving it enough control to rid the clear zone of all obstructions (objects so far as they project above the approach surfaces established by [[Volume 2/E Airspace/0077 Safe, efficient use, and preservation of the navigable airspace.md#§77.27   Initiation of studies.|§77.27]] (b) and (c) of [[Volume 2/E Airspace/0077 Safe, efficient use, and preservation of the navigable airspace.md|part 77 of this chapter]]), and to prevent the creation of future obstructions; together with the right of entrance and exit for those purposes, to ensure the safe and unrestricted passage of aircraft in and over the area.

\[Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12349, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-7, 30 FR 7484, June 8, 1965; Amdt. 151-21, 33 FR 258, Jan. 9, 1968\]

### §151.11   Runway clear zones; requirements.

\(a\) In projects involving grants-in-aid under the Federal-aid Airport Program, a sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire an adequate property interest in runway clear zone areas as prescribed in paragraph (b), (c), (d), or (e) of this section, as applicable. Property interests that a sponsor acquires to meet the requirements of this section are eligible for inclusion in the Program.

\(b\) On new airports, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire adequate property interests in runway clear zone areas (in connection with initial land acquisition) for all eligible runways or landing strips, without substantial deviation from standard configuration and length.

\(c\) On existing airports where new runways or landing strips are developed, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire adequate property interests in runway clear zone areas for each runway and landing strip to be developed or extended, to the extent that the Administrator determines practical and feasible considering all facts presented by the airport owner or operator, preferably without substantial deviation from standard configuration and length.

\(d\) On existing airports where improvements are made to runways or landing strips, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire adequate property interests in runway clear zone areas for each runway or landing strip that is to be improved to the extent that the Administrator determines is practical and feasible with regard to standard configuration, length, and property interests, considering all facts presented by the airport owner or operator. Any development that improves a specific runway or landing strip is considered to be a runway improvement, including runway lighting and the developing or lighting of taxiways serving a runway.

\(e\) On existing airports where substantial improvements are made that do not benefit a specific runway or landing strip, such as overall grading or drainage, terminal area or building developments, the sponsor must own, acquire, or agree to acquire adequate property interests in runway clear zone areas for the dominant runway or landing strip to the extent that the Administrator determines is practical and feasible, with regard to standard configuration, length, and property interests, considering all facts presented by the airport owner or operator.

\(f\) If a sponsor or other public agency shows that it is legally able to prevent the future erection or creation of obstructions in the runway clear zone area, and adopts protective measures to prohibit their future erection or creation, that showing is acceptable for the purposes of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section in place of an adequate property interest (except for rights required for removing existing obstructions). In such a case, there must be an agreement between the FAA and the sponsor for removing or marking or lighting (to be determined in each case) any existing obstruction to air navigation In each case, the sponsor must furnish information as to the specific height limitations established and as to the current and foreseeable future use of the property to which they apply. The information must include an acceptable legal opinion of the validity of the measures adopted, including a conclusion that the height limitations are not unreasonable in view of current and foreseeable future use of the property, and are a reasonable exercise of the police power, together with the reasons or basis supporting the opinion.

\(g\) The authority exercised by the Administrator under paragraphs (b), (c), (d), and (e) of this section to allow a deviation from, or the extent of conformity to, standard configuration or length of runway clear zones, or to determine the adequacy of property interests therein, is also exercised by Regional Directors.

\[Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12350, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-22, 33 FR 8267, June 4, 1968; Amdt. 151-25, 33 FR 14535, Sept. 27, 1968\]

### §151.13   Federal-aid Airport Program: Policy affecting landing aid requirements.

\(a\) *Landing aid requirements.* No project for developing or improving an airport may be approved for the Program unless it provides for acquiring or installing such of the following landing aids as the Administrator determines are needed for the safe and efficient use of the airport by aircraft, considering the category of the airport and the type and volume of traffic using it:

\(1\) Land needed for installing approach lighting systems (ALS).

\(2\) In-runway lighting.

\(3\) High intensity runway lighting.

\(4\) Runway distance markers.

\(b\) *Specific landing aid requirements.* The landing aids set forth in paragraphs (a) (1) through (4) of this section are required for the safe and efficient use of airports by aircraft in the following cases:

\(1\) Lands for installing approach lighting systems are required as part of a project if the installing of the components of the system on the airport is in an approved FAA budget, unless the sponsor has already acquired the land necessary for the system or is otherwise undertaking to acquire that land. If the sponsor is otherwise undertaking to acquire the land, the grant agreement for the project must obligate the sponsor to complete the acquisition within a time limit prescribed by the Administrator. The Administrator immediately notifies a sponsor when a budget is approved providing for installing an approach lighting system at the airport concerned.

\(2\) In-runway lighting is required as part of a project:

\(i\) If the project includes:

(*a*) Construction of a new runway designated by the FAA as an instrument landing runway for which the installation of an IFR precision approach system including ALS and ILS, has been programmed by the FAA with funds then available therefor;

(*b*) An extension of 3,000 feet or more (usable for landing purposes) of the approach end of a designated instrument landing runway equipped, or programed by the FAA, with funds then available therefor, to be equipped, with an IFR precision approach system including ALS and ILS;

(*c*) Reconstruction of a designated instrument landing runway equipped, or programed by the FAA, with funds then available therefor, to be equipped with an IFR precision approach system including ALS and ILS, if the reconstruction requires the closing of the runway; or

(*d*) Any other airport development on an airport whose designated instrument landing runway is equipped, or programed by the FAA, with funds then available therefor, to be equipped with an IFR precision approach system including ALS and ILS; and

\(ii\) Only if a study of the airport shows that in-runway lighting is required for the safe and efficient use of the airport by aircraft, after the Administrator considers the following:

(*a*) The type and volume of flight activity;

(*b*) Other existing or planned navigational aids;

(*c*) Airport environmental factors such as local weather conditions and adjacent geographic profiles;

(*d*) Approach and departure paths;

(*e*) Effect on landing and takeoff minima; and

(*f*) In the case of projects under paragraph (b)(2)(i)(*d*) of this section, whether installing in-runway lighting requires closing the runway for so long a time that the adverse effect on safety of its closing would outweigh the contribution to safety that would be gained by the in-runway lights or whether it would unduly interfere with the efficiency of aircraft operations.

\(3\) High intensity runway edge lighting on the designated instrument landing runway is required as a part of a project whenever that runway is equipped or programmed for the installation of an ILS and high intensity runway edge lights are not then installed on the runway or included in another project. A project for extending a runway that has high intensity runway edge lights on the existing runway requires, as a part of the project, the extension of the high intensity runway edge lights.

\(4\) Runway distance markers whose design standards have been approved and published by the FAA are required as a part of a project on a case-by-case basis if, after reviewing the pertinent facts and circumstances of the case, the Administrator determines that they are needed for the safe and efficient use of the airport by aircraft.

\[Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12350, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-3, 28 FR 12613, Nov. 27, 1963; Amdt. 151-33, 34 FR 9708, June 21, 1969\]

### §151.15   Federal-aid Airport Program: Policy affecting runway or taxiway remarking.

No project for developing or improving an airport may be approved for the Program unless it provides for runway or taxiway remarking if the present marking is obliterated by construction, alteration or repair work included in a FAAP project or by the required routing of construction equipment used therein.

\[Amdt. 151-17, 31 FR 16524, Dec. 28, 1966\]

## Subpart B—Rules and Procedures for Airport Development Projects

### §151.21   Procedures: Application; general information.

\(a\) An eligible sponsor that desires to obtain Federal aid for eligible airport development must submit to the Area Manager of the area in which the sponsor is located (hereinafter in this part referred to as the “Area Manager”), a request on FAA Form 5100-3, accompanied by—

\(1\) The sponsor's written statement as to whether the proposed project involves the displacement and relocation of persons residing on land physically acquired or to be acquired for the project development; and

\(2\) The sponsor's written assurance, if the project involves displacement and relocation of such persons, that adequate replacement housing will be available or provided for (built, if necessary), without regard to their race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, before the execution of a grant agreement for the project.

\(b\) A proposed project is selected for inclusion in a program only if the sponsor has submitted a written assurance when required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section, or if the Administrator has determined that the project does not involve the displacement and relocation of persons residing on land to be physically acquired or to be acquired for the project development. If the Administrator selects a proposed project for inclusion in a program, a tentative allocation of funds is made for it and the sponsor is notified of the allocation. The tentative allocation may be withdrawn if the sponsor fails to submit an acceptable project application as provided in paragraph (c) of this section or fails to proceed diligently with the project, or if adequate replacement housing is not available or provided for in accordance with a written assurance when required by paragraph (a)(2) of this section.

\(c\) As soon as practicable after receiving notice of the tentative allocation, the sponsor must submit a project application on FAA Form 1624 to the Area Manager, without changing the language of the form, unless the change is approved in advance by the Administrator. In the case of a joint project, each sponsor executes only those provisions of the project application that apply to it. A sponsor who has executed a grant agreement for a project for the development of an airport under the Program, may, in the Administrator's discretion, submit additional project applications on FAA Form 1624 for further development of that airport.

(49 U.S.C. 1120, 1655(c); sec. 6(c), Dept. of Transportation Act; sec. 1.4(b)(1) of the regulations of the Office of the Secretary of Transportation; Federal Airport Act, as amended)

\[Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12351, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-11, 31 FR 6686, May 5, 1966; Amdt. 151-32, 34 FR 9617, June 19, 1969; Amdt. 151-39, 35 FR 5536, Apr. 3, 1970\]

### §151.23   Procedures: Application; funding information.

Each sponsor must state in its application that it has on hand, or show that it can obtain as needed, funds to pay all estimated costs of the proposed project that are not borne by the United States or by another sponsor. If any of the funds are to be furnished to a sponsor, or used to pay project costs on behalf of a sponsor, by a State agency or any other public agency that is not a sponsor of the project, that agency may, instead of the sponsor, submit evidence that the funds will be provided if the project is approved.

\[Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12351, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-34, 34 FR 12883, Aug. 8, 1969\]

### §151.24   Procedures: Application; information on estimated project costs.

\(a\) If any part of the estimated project costs consists of the value of donated land, labor, materials, or equipment, or of the value of a property interest in land acquired at a cost that (as represented by the sponsor) is not the actual cost or the amount of an award in eminent domain proceedings, the sponsor must so state in the application, indicating the nature of the donation or other transaction and the value it places on it.

\(b\) If, after the grant agreement is executed and before the final payment of the allowable project costs is made under [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.63   Grant payments: Semifinal and final.|§151.63]], it appears that the sponsor inadvertently or unknowingly failed to comply with paragraph (a) of this section as to any item, the Administrator—

\(1\) Makes or obtains an appraisal of the item, and if the appraised value is less than the value placed on the item in the project application, notifies the sponsor that it may, within a stated time, ask in writing for reconsideration of the appraisal and submit statements of pertinent facts and opinion; and

\(2\) Adjusts the U.S. share of the project costs to reflect any decrease in value of the item below that stated in the project application.

\[Amdt. 151-34, 34 FR 12883, Aug. 8, 1969\]

### §151.25   Procedures: Application; information as to property interests.

\(a\) Each sponsor must state in its application all of the property interests that he holds in the lands to be developed or used as part of, or in connection with, the airport as it will be when the project is completed. Each project application contains a covenant on the part of the sponsor to acquire, before starting construction work, or within a reasonable time if not needed for the construction, property interests satisfactory to the Administrator in all the lands in which it does not hold those property interests at the time it submits the application. In the case of a joint project, any one or more of the sponsors may hold or acquire the necessary property interests. In such a case, each sponsor may show on its application only those property interests that it holds or is to acquire.

\(b\) Each sponsor of a project must send with its application a property map (designated as Exhibit A) or incorporate such a map by reference to one in a previous application that was approved. The sponsor must clearly identify on the map all property interests required in paragraph (a) of this section, showing prior and proposed acquisitions for which United States aid is requested under the project.

\(c\) For the purposes of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section, the property interest that the sponsor must have or agree to obtain, is—

\(1\) Title free and clear of any reversionary interest, lien, easement, lease, or other encumbrance that, in the opinion of the Administrator, would create an undue risk that it might deprive the sponsor of possession or control, interfere with its use for public airport purposes, or make it impossible for the sponsor to carry out the agreements and covenants in the application;

\(2\) A lease of not less than 20 years granted to the sponsor by another public agency that has title as described in paragraph (c)(1) of this section, on terms that the Administrator considers satisfactory; or

\(3\) In the case of an offsite area an agreement, easement, leasehold, or other right or property interest that, in the Administrator's opinion, provides reasonable assurance that the sponsor will not be deprived of its right to use the land for the intended purpose during the period necessary to meet the requirements of the grant agreement.

\(d\) For the purposes of this section, the word “land” includes landing areas, building areas, runway clear zones, clearways and approach zones, and areas required for offsite construction, entrance roads, drainage, protection of approaches, installation of air navigation facilities, or other airport purposes.

### §151.26   Procedures: Applications; compatible land use information; consideration of local community interest; relocation of displaced persons.

\(a\) Each sponsor must state in its application the action that it has taken to restrict the use of land adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of the airport to activities and purposes compatible with normal airport operations including landing and take-off of aircraft. The sponsor's statement must include information on—

\(1\) Any property interests (such as airspace easements or title to airspace) acquired by the sponsor to assure compatible land use, or to protect or control aerial approaches;

\(2\) Any zoning laws enacted or in force restricting the use of land adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, or assuring protection or control of aerial approaches, whether or not enacted by the sponsor; and

\(3\) Any action taken by the sponsor to induce the appropriate government authority to enact zoning laws restricting the use of land adjacent to or in the vicinity of the airport, or assuring protection or control of aerial approaches, when the sponsor lacks the power to zone the land.

\(b\) Each sponsor must submit with his application—

\(1\) A written statement—

\(i\) Specifying what consideration has been given to the interest of all communities in or near which the project is located; and

\(ii\) Containing the substance of any objection to, or approval of, the proposed project made known to the sponsor by any local individual, group or community; and

\(2\) A written statement showing that adequate replacement housing that is open to all persons, regardless of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, is available and has been offered on the same nondiscriminatory basis to persons who have resided on land physically acquired or to be acquired for the project development and who will be displaced thereby.

\[Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8039, June 23, 1965, as amended by Amdt. 151-17, 31 FR 16524, Dec. 28, 1966; Amdt. 151-39, 35 FR 5537, Apr. 3, 1970\]

### §151.27   Procedures: Application, plans, specifications, and appraisals.

\(a\) Except as provided in paragraph (b) of this section, each sponsor shall incorporate by reference in its project application the final plans and specifications, describing the items of airport development for which it requests United States aid. It must submit the plans and specifications with the application unless they were previously submitted or are submitted with that of another sponsor of the project.

\(b\) In special cases, the Administrator authorizes the postponement of the submission of final plans and specifications until a later date to be specified in the grant agreement, if the sponsor has submitted—

\(1\) An airport layout plan approved by the Administrator; and

\(2\) Preliminary plans and specifications in enough detail to identify all items of development included in the project, and prepared so as to provide for accomplishing the project in accordance with the master plan layout, the rules in subparts B and C and applicable local laws and regulations.

\(c\) If the project involves acquiring a property interest in land by donation, or at a cost that (as represented by the sponsor) is not the actual cost or the amount of an award in eminent domain proceedings, the Administrator, before passing on the eligibility of the project makes or obtains an appraisal of the interest. If the appraised value is less than the value placed on the interest by the sponsor ([[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.23   Procedures: Application; funding information.|§151.23]]), the Administrator notifies the sponsor that he may within a stated time, ask in writing for reconsideration of the appraisal and submit statements of pertinent facts and opinion.

\[Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12351, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8039, June 23, 1965; Amdt. 151-17, 31 FR 16524, Dec. 28, 1966\]

### §151.29   Procedures: Offer, amendment, and acceptance.

\(a\) Upon approving a project, the Administrator makes an offer to the sponsor to pay the United States share of the allowable project costs. The offer states a definite amount as the maximum obligation of the United States, and is subject to change or withdrawal by the Administrator, in his discretion, at any time before it is accepted.

\(b\) If, before the sponsor accepts the offer, it is determined that the maximum obligation of the United States stated in the offer is not enough to pay the United States share of the allowable project costs, the sponsor may request an increase in the amount in the offer, through the Area Manager.

\(c\) An official of the sponsor must accept the offer for the sponsor within the time prescribed in the offer, and in the required number of counterparts, by signing it in the space provided. The signing official must have been authorized to sign the acceptance by a resolution or ordinance adopted by the sponsor's governing body. The resolution or ordinance must, as appropriate under the local law—

\(1\) Set forth the terms of the offer at length; or

\(2\) Have a copy of the offer attached to the resolution or ordinance and incorporated into it by reference.

### §151.31   Procedures: Grant agreement.

\(a\) An offer by the Administrator, and acceptance by the sponsor, as set forth in [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.29   Procedures: Offer, amendment, and acceptance.|§151.29]], constitute a grant agreement between the sponsor and the United States. Except as provided in [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.41   Project costs.|§151.41]](c)(3), the United States does not pay, and is not obligated to pay, any part of the project costs that have been or may be incurred, before the grant agreement is executed.

\(b\) The Administrator and the sponsor may agree to a change in a grant agreement if—

\(1\) The change does not increase the maximum obligation of the United States under the grant agreement by more than 10 percent;

\(2\) The change provides only for airport development that meets the requirements of subparts B and C; and

\(3\) The change does not prejudice the interests of the United States.

\(c\) When a change is agreed to, the Administrator issues a supplemental agreement incorporating the change. The sponsor must accept the supplemental agreement in the manner provided in [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.29   Procedures: Offer, amendment, and acceptance.|§151.29]](c).

\[Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12351, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8040, June 23, 1965\]

### §151.33   Cosponsorship and agency.

\(a\) Any two or more public agencies that desire to participate either in accomplishing development under a project or in maintaining or operating the airport, may cosponsor it if they meet the requirements of subparts B and C, including—

\(1\) The eligibility requirements of [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.37   Sponsor eligibility.|§151.37]]; and

\(2\) The submission of a single project application, executed by each sponsor, clearly stating the certifications, representations, warranties, and obligations made or assumed by each, or a separate application by each that does not meet all the requirements of subparts B and C if in the Administrator's opinion, the applications collectively meet the requirements of subparts B and C as applied to a project with a single sponsor.

\(b\) A public agency that desires to participate in a project only by contributing funds to a sponsor need not become a sponsor or an agent of the sponsor, as provided in this section. However, any funds that it contributes are considered as funds of the sponsor for the purposes of the Federal Airport Act and this part.

\(c\) If the sponsors of a joint project are not each willing to assume, jointly and severally, the obligations that subparts B and C requires a sponsor to assume, they must send a true copy of an agreement between them, satisfactory to the Administrator, to be incorporated into the grant agreement. Each agreement must state—

\(1\) The responsibilities of each sponsor to the others with respect to accomplishing the proposed development and operating and maintaining the airport;

\(2\) The obligations that each will assume to the United States; and

\(3\) The name of the sponsor or sponsors who will accept, receipt for, and disburse grant payments.

### §151.45   Performance of construction work: General requirements.

\(a\) All construction work under a project must be performed under contract, except in a case where the Administrator determines that the project, or a part of it, can be more effectively and economically accomplished on a force account basis by the sponsor or by another public agency acting for or as agent of the sponsor.

\(b\) Each contract under a project must meet the requirements of local law.

\(c\) No sponsor may issue any change order under any of its construction contracts or enter into a supplemental agreement unless three copies of that order or agreement have been sent to and approved by the Area Manager. [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.47   Performance of construction work: Letting of contracts.|§§151.47]] and 151.49 apply to supplemental agreements as well as to original contracts.

\(d\) This section and [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.47   Performance of construction work: Letting of contracts.|§§151.47]] through 151.49 do not apply to contracts with the owners of airport hazards, (as described in [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.39   Project eligibility.|§151.39]](b)), buildings, pipe lines, power lines, or other structures or facilities, for installing, extending, changing, removing, or relocating that structure or facility. However, the sponsor must obtain the approval of the Area Manager before entering into such a contract.

\(1\) The sponsor has furnished three conformed copies of the contract to the Area Manager; and

\(2\) The Area Manager agrees to the issuance of a notice to proceed with the work to the contractor. However, the Area Manager does not agree to the issuance of such a notice unless he is satisfied that adequate replacement housing is available and has been offered to affected persons, as required for project eligibility by [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.39   Project eligibility.|§151.39]](a)(5).

\(f\) Except when the Area Manager determines that the sponsor has previously demonstrated satisfactory engineering and construction supervision and inspection, no sponsor may allow a contractor or subcontractor to begin work, nor may the sponsor begin force account work, until the sponsor has notified the Area Manager in writing that engineering and construction supervision and inspection have been arranged to insure that construction will conform to FAA approved plans and specifications, and that the sponsor has caused a review to be made of the qualifications of personnel who will be performing such supervision and inspection and is satisfied that they are qualified to do so.

\[Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12351, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-31, 34 FR 4885, Mar. 6, 1969; Amdt. 151-39, 35 FR 5537, Apr. 3, 1970\]

### §151.47   Performance of construction work: Letting of contracts.

\(a\) *Advertising required; exceptions.* Unless the Administrator approves another method for use on a particular airport development project, each contract for construction work on a project in the amount of more than \$2,000 must be awarded on the basis of public advertising and open competitive bidding under the local law applicable to the letting of public contracts. Any oral or written agreement or understanding between a sponsor and another public agency that is not a sponsor of the project, under which that public agency undertakes construction work for or as agent of the sponsor, is not considered to be a construction contract for the purposes of this section, or [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.45   Performance of construction work: General requirements.|§§151.45]], 151.49, and 151.51.

\(b\) *Advertisement; conditions and contents.* There may be no advertisement for bids on, or negotiation of, a construction contract until the Administrator has approved the plans and specifications. The advertisement shall inform the bidders of the contract and reporting provisions required by [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.54   Equal employment opportunity requirements: Before July 1, 1968.|§151.54]]. Unless the estimated contract price or construction cost is \$2,000 or less, there may be no advertisement for bids or negotiation until the Administrator has given the sponsor a copy of a decision of the Secretary of Labor establishing the minimum wage rates for skilled and unskilled labor under the proposed contract. In each case, a copy of the wage determination decision must be set forth in the initial invitation for bids or proposed contract or incorporated therein by reference to a copy set forth in the advertised or negotiated specifications.

\(c\) *Procedure for the Secretary of Labor's wage determinations.* At least 60 days before the intended date of advertising or negotiating under paragraph (b) of this section, the sponsor shall send to the Area Manager, completed Department of Labor Form DB-11, with only the classifications needed in the performance of the work checked. General entries (such as “entire schedule” or “all applicable classifications”) may not be used. Additional necessary classifications not on the form may be typed in the blank spaces or on an attached separate list. A classification that can be fitted into classifications on the form, or a classification that is not generally recognized in the area or in the industry, may not be used. Except in areas where the wage patterns are clearly established, the Form must be accompanied by any available pertinent wage payment or locally prevailing fringe benefit information.

\(d\) *Use and effectiveness of the Secretary of Labor's wage determinations.* (1) Wage determinations are effective only for 120 days from the date of the determinations. If it appears that a determination may expire between bid opening and award, the sponsor shall so advise the FAA as soon as possible. If he wishes a new request for wage determination to be made and if any pertinent circumstances have changed, he shall submit a new Form DB-11 and accompanying information. If he claims that the determination expires before award and after bid opening due to unavoidable circumstances, he shall submit proof of the facts which he claims support a finding to that effect.

\(2\) The Secretary of Labor may modify any wage determination before the award of the contract or contracts for which it was sought. If the proposed contract is awarded on the basis of public advertisement and open competitive bidding, any modification that the FAA receives less than 10 days before the opening of bids is not effective, unless the Administrator finds that there is reasonable time to notify bidders. A modification may not continue in effect beyond the effective period of the wage determination to which it relates. The Administrator sends any modification to the sponsor as soon as possible. If the modification is effective, it must be incorporated in the invitation for bids, by issuing an addendum to the specifications or otherwise.

\(e\) *Requirements for awarding construction contracts.* A sponsor may not award a construction contract without the written concurrence of the Administrator (through the Area Manager) that the contract prices are reasonable and that the contract conforms to the sponsor's grant agreement with the United States. A sponsor that awards contracts on the basis of public advertising and open competitive bidding, shall, after the bids are opened, send a tabulation of the bids and its recommendations for award to the Area Manager. The allowable project costs of the work, on which the Federal participation is computed, may not be more than the bid of the lowest responsible bidder. The sponsor may not accept a bid by a contractor whose name appears on the current list of ineligible contractors published by the Comptroller General of the United States under §5.6(b) of Title 29 of the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR part 5), or a bid by any firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which that contractor has a substantial interest.

\(f\) *Secretary of Labor's interpretations apply.* Where applicable by their terms, the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR 5.20-5.32) interpreting the fringe benefit provisions of the Davis-Bacon Act apply to this section.

\[Amdt. 151-6, 29 FR 18001, Dec. 18, 1964\]

### §151.49   Performance of construction work: Contract requirements.

\(a\) *Contract provisions.* In addition to any other provisions necessary to ensure completion of the work in accordance with the grant agreement, each sponsor entering into a construction contract for an airport development project shall insert in the contract the provisions required by the Secretary of Labor, as set forth in appendix H of this part. The Director, Airports Service, may amend any provision in appendix H from time to time to accord with rule-making action of the Secretary of Labor. The provisions in the following paragraphs also must be inserted in the contract:

\(1\) *Federal Aid to Airport Program Project.* The work in this contract is included in Federal-aid Airport Project No. \_\_, which is being undertaken and accomplished by the \[insert sponsor's name\] in accordance with the terms and conditions of a grant agreement between the \[insert sponsor's name\] and the United States, under the Federal Airport Act (49 U.S.C. 1101) and part 151 of the Federal Aviation Regulations ([[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md|14 CFR part 151]]), pursuant to which the United States has agreed to pay a certain percentage of the costs of the project that are determined to be allowable project costs under that Act. The United States is not a party to this contract and no reference in this contract to the FAA or any representative thereof, or to any rights granted to the FAA or any representative thereof, or the United States, by the contract, makes the United States a party to this contract.

\(2\) *Consent to assignment.* The contractor shall obtain the prior written consent of the \[insert sponsor's name\] to any proposed assignment of any interest in or part of this contract.

\(3\) *Convict labor.* No convict labor may be employed under this contract.

\(5\) *Withholding: Sponsor from contractor.* Whether or not payments or advances to the \[insert sponsor's name\] are withheld or suspended by the FAA, the \[insert sponsor's name\] may withhold or cause to be withheld from the contractor so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary to pay laborers and mechanics employed by the contractor or any subcontractor on the work the full amount of wages required by this contract.

\(6\) *Nonpayment of wages.* If the contractor or subcontractor fails to pay any laborer or mechanic employed or working on the site of the work any of the wages required by this contract the \[insert sponsor's name\] may, after written notice to the contractor, take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until the violations cease.

\(7\) *FAA inspection and review.* The contractor shall allow any authorized representative of the FAA to inspect and review any work or materials used in the performance of this contract.

\(8\) *Subcontracts.* The contractor shall insert in each of his subcontracts the provisions contained in paragraphs \[insert designations of 6 paragraphs of contract corresponding to paragraphs (1), (3), (4), (5), (6) and (7) of this paragraph\], and also a clause requiring the subcontractors to include these provisions in any lower tier subcontracts which they may enter into, together with a clause requiring this insertion in any further subcontracts that may in turn be made.

\(9\) *Contract termination.* A breach of paragraphs \[insert designation of 3 paragraphs corresponding to paragraphs (6), (7) and (8) of this paragraph\] may be grounds for termination of the contract.

\(b\) *Exemption of certain contracts.* Appendix H to this part and paragraph (a)(5) of this section do not apply to prime contracts of \$2,000 or less.

\(c\) *Adjustment in liquidated damages.* A contractor or subcontractor who has become liable for liquidated damages under paragraph G of appendix H and who claims that the amount administratively determined as liquidated damages under section 104(a) of the Contract Work Hours Standards Act is incorrect or that he violated inadvertently the Contract Work Hours Standards Act notwithstanding the exercise of due care, may—

\(1\) If the amount determined is more than \$100, apply to the Administrator for a recommendation to the Secretary of Labor that an appropriate adjustment be made or that he be relieved of liability for such liquidated damages; or

\(2\) If the amount determined is \$100 or less, apply to the Administrator for an appropriate adjustment in liquidated damages or for release from liability for the liquidated damages.

\(d\) *Corrected wage determinations.* The Secretary of Labor corrects any wage determination included in any contract under this section whenever the wage determination contains clerical errors. A correction may be made at the Administrator's request or on the initiative of the Secretary of Labor.

\(e\) *Secretary of Labor's interpretations apply.* Where applicable by their terms, the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR 5.20-5.32) interpreting the “fringe benefit provisions” of the Davis-Bacon Act apply to the contract provisions in appendix H, and to this section.

\[Amdt. 151-6, 29 FR 18001, Dec. 18, 1964, as amended by Amdt. 151-7, 30 FR 7484, June 6, 1965\]

### §151.51   Performance of construction work: Sponsor force account.

### §151.53   Performance of construction work: Labor requirements.

A sponsor who is required to include in a construction contract the labor provisions required by [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.49   Performance of construction work: Contract requirements.|§151.49]] shall require the contractor to comply with those provisions and shall cooperate with the FAA in effecting that compliance. For this purpose the sponsor shall—

\(a\) Keep, and preserve, for a three-year period beginning on the date the contract is completed, each affidavit and payroll copy furnished by the contractor, and make those affidavits and copies available to the FAA, upon request, during that period;

\(b\) Have each of those affidavits and payrolls examined by its resident engineer (or any other of its employees or agents who are qualified to make the necessary determinations), as soon as possible after receiving it, to the extent necessary to determine whether the contractor is complying with the labor provisions required by [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.49   Performance of construction work: Contract requirements.|§151.49]] and particularly with respect to whether the contractor's employees are correctly classified;

\(c\) Have investigations made during the performance of work under the contract, to the extent necessary to determine whether the contractor is complying with those labor provisions, particularly with respect to whether the contractor's employees are correctly classified, including in the investigations, interviews with employees and examinations of payroll information at the work site by the sponsor's resident engineer (or any other of its employees or agents who are qualified to make the necessary determinations); and

\(d\) Keep the Area Manager fully advised of all examinations and investigations made under this section, all determinations made on the basis of those examinations and investigations, and all efforts made to obtain compliance with the labor provisions of the contract.

### §151.54   Equal employment opportunity requirements: Before July 1, 1968.

In conformity with Executive Order 11246 of September 24, 1965 (30 FR 12319, 3 CFR, 1965 Supp., p. 167) the regulations of the former President's Committee on Equal Employment Opportunity, 41 CFR part 60-1 (28 FR 9812, 11305), as adopted “to the extent not inconsistent with Executive Order 11246” by the Secretary of Labor (“Transfer of Functions,” Oct. 19, 1965, 30 FR 13441), are incorporated by reference into subparts B and C of this part as set forth below. They are referred to in this section by section numbers of part 60-1 of title 41.

\(a\) *Equal employment opportunity requirements.* There are hereby incorporated by reference into subparts B and C, as requirements, the provisions of §60-1.3(b)(1). The FAA is primarily responsible for the sponsor's compliance.

\(b\) *Equal employment opportunity requirements in construction contracts.* The sponsor shall cause the “equal opportunity clause” in §60-1.3(b)(1) to be incorporated into all prime contracts and subcontracts as required by §60-1.3(c).

\(c\) *Reporting requirements for contractors and subcontractors.* The sponsor shall cause the filing of compliance reports by contractors and subcontractors as provided in §60-1.6(a) and the furnishing of such other information as may be required under that provision.

\(d\) *Bidders' reports.* (1) The sponsor shall include in his invitations for bids or negotiations for contracts, and shall require his contractors to include in their invitations for bids or negotiations for subcontracts, the following provisions based on §60-1.6(b)(1):

<div>

Each bidder, prospective contractor or proposed subcontractor shall state as an initial part of the bid or negotiations of the contract whether he has participated in any previous contract or subcontract subject to the equal opportunity clause and, if so, whether he has filed with the Office of Federal Contract Compliance in the United States Department of Labor or the contracting or administering agency all compliance reports due under applicable instructions. In any case in which a bidder or prospective contractor or proposed subcontractor who has participated in a previous contract or subcontract subject to the equal opportunity clause has not filed a compliance report due under applicable instructions, such bidder, prospective contractor or proposed subcontractors shall submit a compliance report prior to the award of the proposed contract or subcontract. When a determination has been made to award a contract to a specific contractor, such contractor shall, prior to award, furnish such other pertinent information regarding his own employment policies and practices as well as those of his proposed subcontractors as the FAA, the sponsor, or the Director of the Office of Federal Contract compliance may require.

</div>

\(2\) The sponsor or his contractors shall give express notice of the requirements of this paragraph (d) in all invitations for bids or negotiations for contracts.

\(e\) *Enforcement.* The FAA conducts compliance reviews, handles complaints and, where appropriate, conducts hearings and imposes, or recommends to the Office of Federal Contract Compliance, sanctions, as provided in subpart B—General Enforcement; Complaint Procedure of part 60-1.

\(f\) *Exempted contracts.* Except for subcontracts for the performance of construction work at the site of construction, the requirements of this section do not apply to subcontracts below the second tier (§60-1.3(c)). The requirements of this section do not apply to contracts and subcontracts exempted by §60-1.4.

\(g\) *Meaning of terms.* The term *“applicant”* in the provisions of part 60-1 incorporated by reference in this section means the sponsor, except where part 60-1 refers to an applicant for employment, and the term “administering agency” therein means the FAA.

\(h\) *Applicability to existing agreements and contracts.* This section applies to grant agreements made after December 20, 1964, and before July 1, 1968. Except as provided in [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.54   Equal employment opportunity requirements: Before July 1, 1968.|§151.54]]A(b), it applies to contracts and subcontracts as defined in §60-1.2 (i) and (k) of Title 41 made in accordance with a grant agreement to which this section applies.

\[Amdt. 151-23, 33 FR 9543, June 29, 1968\]

### §151.55   Accounting and audit.

\(a\) Each sponsor shall establish and maintain, for each individual project, an adequate accounting record to allow appropriate personnel of the FAA to determine all funds received (including funds of the sponsor and funds received from the United States or other sources), and to determine the allowability of all incurred costs of the project. The sponsor shall segregate and group project costs so that it can furnish, on due notice, cost information in the following cost classifications:

\(1\) Purchase price or value of land.

\(2\) Incidental costs of land acquisition.

\(3\) Costs of contract construction.

\(4\) Costs of force account construction.

\(5\) Engineering costs of plans and designs.

\(6\) Engineering costs of supervision and inspection.

\(7\) Other administrative costs.

\(b\) The sponsor shall obtain and retain in its files for a period of three years after the date of the final grant payment, documentary evidence such as invoices, cost estimates, and payrolls supporting each item of project costs.

\(c\) The sponsor shall retain, for a period of three years after the date of the final grant payment, evidence of all payments for items of project costs including vouchers, cancelled checks or warrants, and receipts for cash payments.

\(d\) The sponsor shall allow the Administrator and the Comptroller General of the United States, or an authorized representative of either of them, access to any of its books, documents, papers, and records that are pertinent to grants received under the Federal-aid Airport Program for the purposes of accounting and audit. Appropriate FAA personnel may make progress audits at any time during the project, upon notice to the sponsor. If work is suspended on the project for an appreciable period of time, an audit will be made before any semi-final payment is made. In each case an audit is made before the final payment.

\[Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12351, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8040, June 23, 1965\]

### §151.57   Grant payments: General.

\(a\) An application for a grant payment is made on FAA Form 5100-6, accompanied by—

\(1\) A summary of project costs on Form FAA-1630;

\(2\) A periodic cost estimate on Form FAA-1629 for each contract representing costs for which payment is requested; and

\(3\) Any supporting information, including appraisals of property interests, that the FAA needs to determine the allowability of any costs for which payment is requested.

\(b\) Contractor's certifications. Each application that involves work performed by a contractor must contain, in the contractor's certification in the periodic cost estimate, a statement that “there has been full compliance with all labor provisions included in the contract identified above and in all subcontracts made under that contract”, and, in the case of a substantial dispute as to the nature of the contractor's or a subcontractor's obligation under the labor provisions of the contract or a subcontract, and additional phrase “except insofar as a substantial dispute exists with respect to these provisions”.

\(c\) If a contractor or subcontractor fails or refuses to comply with the labor provisions of the contract with the sponsor, further grant payments to the sponsor are suspended until the violations stop, until the Administrator determines the allowability of the project costs to which the violations related, or, to the extent that the violations consist of underpayments to labor, until the sponsor furnishes satisfactory assurances to the FAA that restitution has been or will be made to the affected employees.

\(d\) If, upon final determination of the allowability of all project costs of a project, it is found that the total of grant payments to the sponsor was more than the total United States share of the allowable costs of the project, the sponsor shall promptly return the excess to the FAA.

\[Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12351, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-4, 29 FR 11336, Aug. 6, 1964; Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8040, June 23, 1965; Amdt. 151-17, 31 FR 16525, Dec. 28, 1966; Amdt. 151-32, 34 FR 9617, June 19, 1969\]

### §151.59   Grant payments: Land acquisition.

If an approved project includes land acquisition as an item of airport development, the sponsor may, at any time after executing the grant agreement and after title evidence has been approved by the Administrator for the property interest for which payment is requested, apply to the FAA, through the Area Manager, for payment of the United States share of the allowable project costs of the acquisition, including any acquisition that is completed before executing the grant agreement and is part of the airport development included in the project.

### §151.61   Grant payments: Partial.

\(a\) Subject to the final determination of allowable project costs as provided in [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.63   Grant payments: Semifinal and final.|§151.63]] partial grant payments for project costs may be made to a sponsor upon application. Unless previously agreed otherwise, a sponsor may apply for partial payments on a monthly basis. The payments may be paid, upon application, on the basis of the costs of airport development that is accomplished or on the basis of the estimated cost of airport development expected to be accomplished.

\(b\) Except as otherwise provided, partial grant payments are made in amounts large enough to bring the aggregate amount of all partial payments to the estimated United States share of the project costs of the airport development accomplished under the project as of the date of the sponsor's latest application for payment. In addition, if the sponsor applies, a partial grant payment is made as an advance payment in an amount large enough to bring the aggregate amount of all partial payments to the estimated United States share of the estimated project costs of the airport development expected to be accomplished within 30 days after the date of the sponsor's application for advance payment. However, no partial payment may be made in an amount that would bring the aggregate amount of all partial payments for the project to more than 90 percent of the estimated United States share of the total estimated cost of all airport development included in the project, but not including contingency items, or 90 percent of the maximum obligation of the United States as stated in the grant agreement, whichever amount is the lower. In determining the amount of a partial grant payment, those project costs that the Administrator considers to be of questionable allowability are deducted both from the amount of proj- ect costs incurred and from the amount of the estimated total project cost.

### §151.63   Grant payments: Semifinal and final.

\(a\) Whenever airport development on a project is delayed or suspended for an appreciable period of time for reasons beyond the sponsor's control and the allowability of the project costs of all airport development completed has been determined on the basis of an audit and review of all costs, a semifinal grant payment may be made in an amount large enough to bring the aggregate amount of all partial grant payments for the project to the United States share of all allowable project costs incurred, even if the amount is more than the 90 percent limitation prescribed in [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.61   Grant payments: Partial.|§151.61]](b). However, it may not be more than the maximum obligation of the United States as stated in the grant agreement.

\(b\) Whenever the project is completed in accordance with the grant agreement, the sponsor may apply for final payment. The final payment is made to the sponsor if—

\(1\) A final inspection of all work at the airport site has been made jointly by the Area Manager and representatives of the sponsor and the contractor, unless the Area Manager agrees to a different procedure for final inspection.

\(2\) A final audit of the project account has been completed by appropriate personnel of the FAA; and

\(3\) The sponsor has furnished final “as constructed” plans, unless otherwise agreed to by the Administrator.

\(c\) Based upon the final inspection, the final audit, the plans, and the documents and supporting information required by [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.57   Grant payments: General.|§151.57]](a), the Administrator determines the total amount of the allowable project costs and pays the sponsor the United States' share, less the total amount of all prior payments.

### §151.65   Memoranda and hearings.

\(a\) At any time before the FAA issues a grant offer for a project, any public agency or person having a substantial interest in the disposition of the project application may file a memorandum supporting or opposing it with the Area Manager of the area in which the project is located. In addition, that public agency or person may request a public hearing on the location of the airport to be developed. If, in the Administrator's opinion, that public agency or person has a substantial interest in the matter, a public hearing is held.

\(b\) The Administrator sets the time and place of each hearing under this section, to avoid undue delay in disposing of the application, to afford reasonable time for all parties concerned to prepare for it, and to hold it at a place convenient to the sponsor. Notice of the time and place is mailed to the public agency or person filing the memorandum, the sponsor, and any other necessary persons.

\(c\) The purpose of the hearing is to help the Administrator discover facts relating to the location of the airport that is proposed to be developed under an application pending before him. There are no adverse parties or interests and no defendant or respondent. They are not hearings for the purposes of 5 U.S.C. 554, 556, and 557, and do not terminate in an adjudication as defined in that Act.

\(d\) Each hearing under this section is conducted by a hearing officer designated by the Administrator. The hearing officer decides the length of the hearing, the kind of testimony to be heard, and all other matters respecting the conduct of the hearing. The hearing is recorded in a manner determined by the hearing officer and the record becomes a part of the record of the project application. The Administrator's decision is not made solely on the basis of the hearing, but on all relevant facts.

### §151.73   Land acquisition.

\(a\) The acquisition of land or any interest therein, or of any easement or other interest in airspace, is eligible for inclusion in a project if it was made after May 13, 1946, and is necessary—

\(1\) To allow the initial development of the airport;

\(2\) For improvement indicated in the current National Airport Plan;

\(3\) For ultimate development of the airport, as indicated in the current approved airport layout plan to the extent consistent with the National Airport Plan;

\(4\) For approach protection meeting the standards of [[Volume 2/E Airspace/0077 Safe, efficient use, and preservation of the navigable airspace.md#§77.23   Heliport imaginary surfaces.|§77.23]] as applied to [[Volume 2/E Airspace/0077 Safe, efficient use, and preservation of the navigable airspace.md#§77.25   Applicability.|§§77.25]] and 77.27 of this chapter;

\(5\) To allow installing an ALS (as described in [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.13   Federal-aid Airport Program: Policy affecting landing aid requirements.|§151.13]]), in which case the costs of acquiring land needed for it are eligible for 75 percent United States participation if the need is shown in the National Airport Plan, based on the best information available to the FAA for the forecast period;

\(6\) To allow proper use, operation, or maintenance of the airport as a public facility, including offsite lands needed for locating necessary parts of the utility systems serving the airport;

\(7\) To allow installing navigational aids by the FAA, if the land is within the airport boundaries; or

\(8\) To allow relocation of navigational aids.

\(b\) Appendix A of this part sets forth typical eligible and ineligible items of land acquisition as covered by this section.

\[Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12357, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-7, 30 FR 7484, June 8, 1965; Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8040, June 23, 1965\]

### §151.75   Preparation of site.

\(a\) Grading, drainage, and associated items of site preparation are eligible for inclusion in a project, but only with respect to one landing strip at any airport, unless the airport qualifies for more than one runway, based on traffic volume or wind conditions (as outlined in [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.77   Runway paving: General rules.|§151.77]]) and the overall site preparation required for development in accordance with the airport layout plan. The complete clearance of runway clear zone areas is desirable, but, as a minimum, all obstructions as determined by [[Volume 2/E Airspace/0077 Safe, efficient use, and preservation of the navigable airspace.md#§77.23   Heliport imaginary surfaces.|§77.23]] as applied to [[Volume 2/E Airspace/0077 Safe, efficient use, and preservation of the navigable airspace.md#§77.27   Initiation of studies.|§77.27]] (b) and (c) of this chapter must be removed. Grading in runway clear zones is eligible only to remove terrain that is an obstruction. The clear zone is not a graded overrun area. Specific site preparation for an airport terminal building is eligible on the same basis as the building itself. The site preparation cost is prorated based on eligible and ineligible building space. Appendix B of this part sets forth typical eligible and ineligible items of site preparation as covered by this section.

\(b\) For the purposes of this section, eligible drainage work off the airport site includes drainage outfalls, drainage disposal, and interception ditches. If there is damage to adjacent property, its correction is an eligible item for inclusion in the project.

\[Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12357, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-7, 30 FR 7484, June 8, 1965; Amdt. 151-8, 30 FR 8040, June 23, 1965\]

### §151.77   Runway paving: General rules.

\(a\) On any airport, paving of the designated instrument landing runway (or dominant runway if there is no designated instrument runway) is eligible for inclusion in a project, within the limits of the current National Airport Plan. Program participation in constructing, reconstructing or resurfacing is limited to a single runway at each airport, unless more than one runway is eligible under a standard in [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.79   Runway paving: Second runway; wind conditions.|§151.79]] or [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.80   Runway paving: Additional runway; other conditions.|§151.80]].

\(b\) The kinds of runway paving that are eligible for inclusion in a project include pavement construction and reconstruction, and include runway grooving to improve skid resistance, and resurfacing to increase the load bearing capacity of the runway or to provide a leveling course to correct major irregularities in the pavement. Runway resealing or refilling joints as an ordinary maintenance matter are not eligible items, except for bituminous resurfacing consisting of at least 100 pounds of plant-mixed material for each square yard, and except for the application of a bituminous surface treatment (two applications of material and cover aggregate as prescribed in FAA Specification P-609) on a pavement the current surface of which consists of that kind of a bituminous surface treatment.

\(c\) On new pavement construction, the applying of a bituminous seal coat on plant hot-mix bituminous surfaces only, is an eligible item only if initial engineering analysis and design indicate the need for a seal coat. However, any delay in applying it that is caused other than by construction difficulties, makes the application a maintenance item that is not eligible.

\(d\) In any case in which the need for a seal coat is necessary for a new runway extension or partial reconstruction of a runway, the entire runway may be sealed.

### §151.87   Lighting and electrical work: Standards.

(a)-(b) \[Reserved\]

\(c\) The number of runways that are eligible for lighting is the same as the number eligible for paving under [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.77   Runway paving: General rules.|§151.77]], [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.79   Runway paving: Second runway; wind conditions.|§151.79]], or [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.80   Runway paving: Additional runway; other conditions.|§151.80]].

\(d\) The installing of high intensity runway edge lighting is eligible on a designated instrument landing runway and any other runway with approved straight-in approach procedures. A runway that is eligible for lighting, but does not meet the requirements for 75 percent U.S. participation under [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.43   United States share of project costs.|§151.43]](d), is eligible for 50 percent U.S. participation in the costs of high intensity runway edge lighting (or the allowable percentage in [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.43   United States share of project costs.|§151.43]](c) for public land States), if the airport is served by a navigational aid that will allow using instrument approach procedures. If a runway is not eligible for 75 or 50 percent Federal participation in high intensity runway edge lighting but is otherwise eligible for runway lighting, the U.S. share of the cost of runway edge lighting is 50 percent of the cost of the lighting installed but not more than 50 percent of the cost of medium intensity lighting.

\(e\) In-runway lighting (touchdown zone lighting system, and centerline lighting system) is eligible on the designated instrument landing runway.

\(f\) Taxiways to eligible runways on airports served by transport aircraft are eligible for lighting. On airports serving only general aviation, the lighting of connecting taxiways is eligible if the runway served is lighted or is programed to be lighted. The lighting of a parallel taxiway is eligible if the taxiway is eligible for paving. Lighting of other taxiways is eligible or not, depending on the complexity of the taxiway system.

\(g\) Floodlighting of aprons is eligible if there is a proven need for it, including a showing of night operations where the runway is lighted.

\(h\) Any airport that is eligible to participate in the costs of runway lighting is eligible for the installing of an airport beacon, lighted wind indicator, obstruction lights, lighting control equipment, and other components of basic airport lighting, including separate transformer vaults and connection to the nearest available power source.

\(i\) The interconnection of two or more power sources on an airport property, the providing of second sources of power, and the installing of standby engine generators of reasonable capacity, are eligible under the program.

\(j\) Economy approach lighting aids are eligible for inclusion in a project at an airport that will not qualify within the next three years for approach lighting aids installed by FAA under the Facilities and Equipment Program if the economy approach lighting aids—

\(1\) Will correct a visual deficiency on one of the lighted runways of the airport; or

\(b\) Airport utility construction, installation, and connection are eligible under the Federal-aid Airport Program as follows:

\(1\) An airport utility serving only eligible areas and facilities is eligible; and

\(2\) An airport utility serving both eligible and ineligible airport areas and facilities is eligible only to the extent of the additional cost of providing the capacity needed for eligible areas and facilities over and above the capacity necessary for the ineligible areas and facilities.

\(c\) No part of the constructing, altering, or repairing (including grading, drainage, and other site preparation work) of a facility or area that is to be used as a public parking facility for passenger automobiles is eligible for inclusion in a project.

\(d\) Landscaping is not eligible for inclusion in a project. However, the establishment of turf on graded areas and special treatment to prevent slope erosion is eligible to the extent of the eligibility of the facilities or areas served, preserved, or protected by the turf or treatment. In the case of turfing or treatment for an area or facility that is partly eligible and partly ineligible, the eligibility of the turfing or treatment is established on a pro rata basis.

\(e\) The construction of sidewalks is not eligible for inclusion in a project.

\[Doc. No. 1329, 27 FR 12357, Dec. 13, 1962, as amended by Amdt. 151-17, 31 FR 16525, Dec. 28, 1966; Amdt. 151-26, 33 FR 18434, Dec. 12, 1968\]

### §151.95   Fences; distance markers; navigational and landing aids; and offsite work.

\(a\) Boundary or perimeter fences for security purposes are eligible for inclusion in a project.

\(b\) A blast fence is eligible for inclusion in a project whenever—

\(1\) It is necessary for safety at a runway end or a holding area near the end of a runway and its installation would be more economical than the acquiring of additional property interests; or

\(2\) Its installation for safety at a turbojet-passenger gate will result in less separation being needed for gate positions, thereby reducing the need for apron expansion, and it is more economical to build the fence than to expand the apron.

\(c\) The eligibility of runway distance markers for inclusion in a project is decided on a case-by-case basis.

\(d\) The relocation of navigational aids is eligible for inclusion in a proj- ect whenever necessitated by development on the airport under a Program project and the sponsor is responsible under FAA Order OA 6030.1 (Agency Order 53).

\(e\) The installation of any of the following landing aids is eligible for inclusion in a project:

\(1\) Segmented circle.

\(2\) Wind and landing direction indicators.

\(3\) Boundary markers.

\(f\) The initial marking of runway and taxiway systems is eligible for inclusion in a project. The remarking of existing runways or taxiways is eligible if—

\(1\) Present marking is obsolete under current FAA standards; or

\(2\) Present marking is obliterated by construction, alteration or repair work included in a FAAP project or by the required routing of construction equipment used therein.

\(g\) The following offsite work performed outside of the boundaries of an airport or airport site is eligible for inclusion in a project:

\(1\) Removal of obstruction as provided in [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.91   Removal of obstructions.|§151.91]].

The final payment is made upon the sponsor's request after—

\(1\) The conditions of the advance planning grant agreement have been met;

\(2\) Evidence of cost of each item has been submitted; and

\(3\) Audit of submitted evidence or audit of sponsor's records, if considered desirable by FAA, has been made.

\(b\) When the advance planning proposal relates to the selection of an airport site, the advance planning grant agreement provides that Federal funds are paid to the sponsor only after the site is selected and the Administrator is satisfied that the site selected for the airport is reasonably consistent with existing plans of public agencies for development of the area in which the site is located, and will contribute to the accomplishment of the purposes of the Federal-aid Airport Program.

### Appendix H to Part 151

There is set forth below the contract provision required by the regulations of the Secretary of Labor in part 5 of title 29 of the Code of Federal Regulations. Section 151.49(a) requires sponsors to insert this provision in full in each construction contract.

# provision required by the regulations of the secretary of labor

*A. Minimum wages.* (1) All mechanics and laborers employed or working upon the site of the work will be paid unconditionally and not less often than once a week, and without subsequent deduction or rebate on any account (except such payroll deductions as are permitted by regulations issued by the Secretary of Labor under the Copeland Act \[29 CFR part 3\]), the full amounts due at time of payment computed at wage rates not less than those contained in the wage determination decision(s) of the Secretary of Labor which is (are) attached hereto and made a part hereof, regardless of any contractual relationship which may be alleged to exist between the contractor and such laborers and mechanics; and the wage determination decision(s) shall be posted by the contractor at the site of the work in a prominent place where it (they) can be easily seen by the workers. For the purpose of this paragraph, contributions made or costs reasonably anticipated under section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act on behalf of laborers or mechanics are considered wages paid to such laborers or mechanics, subject to the provisions of subparagraph (4) below. Also for the purpose of this paragraph, regular contributions made or costs incurred for more than a weekly period under plans, funds, or programs, but covering the particular weekly period, are deemed to be constructively made or incurred during such weekly period (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(i)).

\(2\) Any class of laborers or mechanics which is not listed in the wage determination(s) and which is to be employed under the contract, shall be classified or reclassified comformably to the wage determination(s), and a report of the action taken shall be sent by the \[insert sponsor's name\] to the FAA for approval and transmittal to the Secretary of Labor. In the event that the interested parties cannot agree on the proper classification or reclassification of a particular class of laborers and mechanics to be used, the question accompanied by the recommendation of the FAA shall be referred to the Secretary of Labor for final determination (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(ii)).

\(3\) Whenever the minimum wage rate prescribed in the contract for a class of laborers or mechanics includes a fringe benefit which is not expressed as an hourly wage rate and the contractor is obligated to pay a cash equivalent of such a fringe benefit, an hourly cash equivalent thereof shall be established. In the event the interested parties cannot agree upon a cash equivalent of the fringe benefit, the question, accompanied by the recommendation of the FAA shall be referred to the Secretary of Labor for determination (29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iii)).

\(4\) If the contractor does not make payments to a trustee or other third person, he may consider as part of the wages of any laborer or mechanic the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program of a type expressly listed in the wage determination decision of the Secretary of Labor which is a part of this contract: *Provided, however,* The Secretary of Labor has found, upon the written request of the contractor, that the applicable standards of the Davis-Bacon Act have been met. The Secretary of Labor may require the contractor to set aside in a separate account assets for the meeting of obligations under the plan or program.

*B. Withholding: FAA from sponsor.* Pursuant to the terms of the grant agreement between the United States and \[insert sponsor's name\], relating to Federal-aid Airport Project No. \_\_\_\_, and part 151 of the Federal Aviation Regulations ([[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md|14 CFR part 151]]), the FAA may withhold or cause to be withheld from the \[insert sponsor's name\] so much of the accrued payments or advances as may be considered necessary to pay laborers and mechanics employed by the contractor or any subcontractor on the work the full amount of wages required by this contract. In the event of failure to pay any laborer or mechanic employed or working on the site of the work all or part of the wages required by this contract, the FAA may, after written notice to the \[insert sponsor's name\], take such action as may be necessary to cause the suspension of any further payment or advance of funds until such violations have ceased (29 CFR 5.5(a)(2)).

*C. Payrolls and basic records.* (1) Payrolls and basic records relating thereto will be maintained during the course of the work and preserved for a period of three years thereafter for all laborers and mechanics working at the site of the work. Such records will contain the name and address of each such employee, his correct classification, rates of pay (including rates of contributions or costs anticipated of the types described in section 1(b)(2) of the Davis-Bacon Act), daily and weekly number of hours worked, deductions made and actual wages paid. Whenever the Secretary of Labor has found, under 29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iv) (see subparagraph (4) of subparagraph (A) above), that the wages of any laborer or mechanic include the amount of any costs reasonably anticipated in providing benefits under a plan or program described in section 1(b)(2)(B) of the Davis-Bacon Act, the contractor shall maintain records which show that the commitment to provide such benefits is enforceable, that the plan or program is financially responsible, and that the plan or program has been communicated in writing to the laborers or mechanics affected, and records which show the costs anticipated or the actual cost incurred in providing such benefits (29 CFR 5.5(a)(3)(i)).

\(2\) The contractor will submit weekly a copy of all payrolls to the \[insert sponsor's name\] for transmission to the FAA, as required by [[Volume 3/I Airports/0151 Federal aid to airports.md#§151.53   Performance of construction work: Labor requirements.|§151.53]](a). The copy shall be accompanied by a statement signed by the employer or his agent indicating that the payrolls are correct and complete, that the wage rates contained therein are not less than those determined by the Secretary of Labor and that the classifications set forth for each laborer or mechanic conform with the work he performed. A submission of a “Weekly Statement of Compliance” which is required under this contract and the Copeland regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR part 3) and the filing with the initial payroll or any subsequent payroll of a copy of any findings by the Secretary of Labor, under 29 CFR 5.5(a)(1)(iv) (see subparagraph (4) of paragraph (A) above), shall satisfy this requirement. The prime contractor shall be responsible for the submission of copies of payrolls of all subcontractors. The contractor will make the records required under the labor standards clauses of the contract available for inspection by authorized representatives of the FAA and the Department of Labor, and will permit such representatives to interview employees during working hours on the job (29 CFR 5.5(a)(3)(ii)).

*D. Apprentices.* Apprentices will be permitted to work as such only when they are registered, individually, under a bona fide apprenticeship program registered with a State apprenticeship agency which is recognized by the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, United States Department of Labor; or, if no such recognized agency exists in a State, under a program registered with the Bureau of Apprenticeship and Training, United States Department of Labor. The allowable ratio of apprentices to journeymen in any craft classification shall not be greater than the ratio permitted to the contractor as to his entire work force under the registered program. Any employee listed on a payroll at an apprentice wage rate, who is not registered as above, shall be paid the wage rate determined by the Secretary of Labor for the classification of work he actually performed. The contractor or subcontractor will be required to furnish to the \[insert sponsor's name\] written evidence of the registration of his program and apprentices as well as of the appropriate ratios and wage rates, for the area of construction prior to using any apprentices on the contract work (29 CFR 5.5(a)(4)).

*E. Compliance with Copeland Regulations.* The contractor shall comply with the Copeland Regulations (29 CFR part 3) of the Secretary of Labor which are herein incorporated by reference (29 CFR 5.5(a)(5)).

*F. Overtime requirements.* No contractor or subcontractor contracting for any part of the contract work which may require or involve the employment of laborers or mechanics shall require or permit any laborer or mechanic in any workweek in which he is employed on such work to work in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such workweek unless such laborer or mechanic received compensation at a rate not less than one and one-half times his basic rate of pay for all hours worked in excess of eight hours in any calendar day or in excess of forty hours in such workweek, as the case may be (29 CFR 5.5(c)(1)).

*G. Violations; liability for unpaid wages; liquidated damages.* In the event of any violation of paragraph F of this provision, the contractor and any subcontractor responsible therefore shall be liable to any affected employee for his unpaid wages. In addition, such contractor and subcontractor shall be liable to the United States for liquidated damages. Such liquidated damages shall be computed, with respect to each individual laborer or mechanic employed in violation of said paragraph F of this provision, in the sum of \$10 for each calendar day on which such employee was required or permitted to work in excess of eight hours or in excess of the standard workweek of forty hours without payment of the overtime wages required by said paragraph F of this provision (29 CFR 5.5 (c)(2)).

*H. Withholding for unpaid wages and liquidated damages, and priority of payment* (1) The FAA may withhold or cause to be withheld, from any moneys payable on account of work performed by the contractor or subcontractor, such sums as may administratively be determined to be necessary to satisfy any liabilities of such contractor or subcontractor for unpaid wages and liquidated damages as provided in paragraph G of this provision (29 CFR 5.5(c)(3)).

\(2\) In the event of failure or refusal of the contractor or any subcontractor to comply with overtime pay requirements of the Contract Work Hours Standards Act, if the funds withheld by the FAA for the violations are not sufficient to pay fully both the unpaid wages due laborers and mechanics and the liquidated damages due the United States, the available funds shall be used first to compensate the laborers and mechanics for the wages to which they are entitled (or an equitable portion thereof when the funds are not adequate for this purpose); and the balance, if any, shall be used for the payment of liquidated damages (29 CFR 5.14 (d)(2)).

*I. Subcontracts.* The contractor will insert in each of his subcontracts the clauses contained in paragraphs A through H and J of this provision, and also a clause requiring the subcontractors to include these provisions in any lower tier subcontracts which they may enter into, together with a clause requiring this insertion in any further subcontracts that may in turn be made (29 CFR 5.5(a)(6), 5.5(c)(4)).

*J. Contract termination; debarment.* A breach of paragraphs A through I of this provision may be grounds for termination of the contract. A breach of paragraphs A through E and I may also be grounds for debarment as provided in 29 CFR 5.6 of the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR 5.5(a)(8)).
