### Appendix C to Part 152—Procurement Procedures and Requirements

There is set forth below procurement procedures and requirements applicable to grants for airport development under the Airport and Airway Development Act of 1970.

1\. *General.* Each contract under a project must meet the requirements of local law and the requirements and standards contained in this appendix. The sponsor shall establish procedures for procurement of supplies, equipment, construction, and services funded under the project which meet the requirements of Attachment O of Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-102 (44 FR 47874) and of this appendix. Subject to funding and time limitations, the FAA reviews the sponsor's procurement system to determine whether it may be certified in accordance with Attachment O of OMB Circular A-102.

2\. *Out-of-state labor.* No procedure or requirement shall be imposed by any grantee which will operate to discriminate against the employment of labor from any other State, possession, or territory of the United States in the construction of a project.

3\. *Bid guarantee.* All bids for construction or facility improvement in excess of \$100,000 shall be accompanied by a bid guarantee consisting of a firm commitment such as a bid bond, certified check or other negotiable instrument equivalent to five percent of the bid price as assurance that the bidder will, upon acceptance of his bid, execute such contractual documents as may be required within the time specified.

4\. *Construction work.* All construction work under a project must be performed under contract, except in a case where the Administrator determines that the project, or a part of it, can be more effectively and economically accomplished on a force account basis by the sponsor or by another public agency acting for or as agent of the sponsor.

5\. *Change order.* Unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator, no sponsor may issue any change order under any of its construction contracts or enter into a supplemental agreement unless three copies of that order or agreement have been sent to, and approved by, the FAA.

6\. *Beginning work.* No sponsor may allow a contractor or subcontractor to begin work under a project until—

a\. The sponsor has furnished three conformed copies of the contract to the appropriate FAA office;

b\. The sponsor has, if applicable, submitted a statement that comparable replacement housing, as defined in §25.15 of the Regulations of the Office of the Secretary of Transportation, will be available within a reasonable period of time before displacement.

c\. The appropriate FAA office has agreed to the issuance of a notice to proceed with the work to the contractor.

7\. *Supervision and inspection.* No work will be commenced until the sponsor has provided for adequate supervision and inspection of construction and advised the appropriate FAA office.

8\. *Engineering and planning services.* Unless otherwise authorized by the Administrator, each proposal for engineering and planning services shall be reviewed by FAA before the commencement of the development of design plans and specifications.

9\. *Advertising general.* Unless the Administrator approves another method for use on a particular airport development project, each contract and supplemental agreement for construction work on a project in the amount of more than \$10,000 must be awarded on the basis of public advertising and open competitive bidding under the local law applicable to the letting of public contracts.

10\. *Advertising: conditions and contents.* There may be no advertisement for bids on, or negotiation of, a construction contract or supplemental agreement until the Administrator has either approved the plans and specifications or accepted a certification in accordance with §152.7 that they meet all applicable standards prescribed by this part. The advertisement shall inform the bidders of the equal employment opportunity requirements of part 152. Unless the estimated contract price or construction cost in \$2,000 or less, there may be no advertisement for bids or negotiations until the Administrator has given the sponsor a copy of a decision of the Secretary of Labor establishing the minimum wage rates for skilled and unskilled labor under the proposed contract. In each case, a copy of the wage determination decision, including fringe benefits, must be set forth in the initial invitation for bids or proposed contract, or incorporated therein by reference to a copy set forth in the advertised or negotiated specifications.

11\. *Procedures for obtaining wage determinations.* (a) *Specific request for wage determination.* At least 60 days before the intended date of advertising or negotiating of this section, the sponsor shall send to the appropriate FAA office, completed Department of Labor Form DB-11 or DB-11(a), as appropriate, with only the classifications needed in the performance of the work checked. General entries (such as “entire schedule” or “all applicable classifications”) may not be used. Additional necessary classifications not on the form may be typed in the blank spaces or on an attached separate list. A classification that can be fitted into classifications on the form, or a classification that is not generally recognized in the area or in the industry, may not be used. Except in areas where the wage patterns are clearly established, the Form must be accompanied by any available pertinent wage payment or locally prevailing fringe benefit information.

\(b\) *General wage determination.* Whenever the wage patterns in a particular area for a particular type of construction are well settled and whenever it may be reasonably anticipated that there will be a large volume of procurement in that area for that type of construction, the Secretary of Labor, upon the request of a Federal agency or in his discretion, may issue a general wage determination when, after consideration of the facts and circumstances involved, he finds that the applicable statutory standards and those of part 1, 29 CFR, subtitle A, will be met. This general wage determination is used for all projects located in the area and for the type of construction covered by the general wage determination.

12\. *Advertising: wage determinations.* (a) Wage determinations are effective only for 120 days from the date of the determinations. If it appears that a determination may expire between bid opening and award, the sponsor shall so advise the FAA as soon as possible. If it wishes a new request for wage determination to be made and if any pertinent circumstances have changed, it shall submit the appropriate form of the Department of Labor and accompanying information. If it claims that the determination expires before award and after bid opening due to unavoidable circumstances, it shall submit proof of the facts which it claims support a finding to that effect.

\(b\) The Secretary of Labor may modify any wage determination before the award of the contract or contracts for which it was sought. If the proposed contract is awarded on the basis of public advertisement and open competitive bidding, any modification that the FAA receives less than 10 days before the opening of bids is not effective, unless the Administrator finds that there is reasonable time to notify bidders. A modification may not continue in effect beyond the effective period of the wage determination to which it relates. The Administrator sends any modification to the sponsor as soon as possible. If the modification is effective, it must be incorporated in the invitation for bids, by issuing an addendum to the specifications or otherwise.

13\. *Awarding contracts.* (a) A sponsor may not award a construction contract without the written concurrence of the Administrator (through the appropriate FAA office) that the contract prices are reasonable. A sponsor that awards contracts on the basis of public advertising and open competitive bidding, shall, after the bids are opened, send a tabulation of the bids and its recommendations for award to the appropriate FAA office. The sponsor may not accept a bid by a contractor whose name appears on the current list of ineligible contractors published by the Comptroller General of the United States under §5.6(b) of the regulations of the Secretary of Labor (29 CFR part 5), or a bid by any firm, corporation, partnership, or association in which an ineligible contractor has a substantial interest.

\(b\) A sponsor's proposed contract must have pre-award review and approval by the FAA in any of the following circumstances:

\(1\) The sponsor's procurement system is not in compliance with one or more significant aspects of Attachment O of OMB Circular A-102 or with the standards of this appendix.

\(2\) The procurement is expected to exceed \$10,000 and is to be awarded without competition or only one bid or offer is received in response to solicitation.

\(3\) The procurement is expected to exceed \$10,000 and specifies a “brand name” product.

\(c\) The FAA may require pre-award review and approval of a sponsor's proposed contract under any of the following circumstances:

\(1\) The sponsor's procurement system has not yet been reviewed by the FAA for compliance with OMB Circular A-102 and this appendix.

\(2\) The sponsor has requested pre-award assistance.

\(3\) The proposal is for automatic data processing in accordance with paragraph C1 of Attachment B to Federal Management Circular 74-4 (39 FR 27133; 43 FR 50977).

\(4\) The proposal is one of a series with the same firm.

\(5\) The proposal is to be performed outside the recipient's established procurement system or office.

\(6\) The proposal is for construction and is to be awarded through the negotiation procurement method or without competition.

14\. *Force account work.* Before undertaking any force account construction work, the sponsor (or any public agency acting as agent for the sponsor) must obtain the written consent of the Administrator through the appropriate FAA office. In requesting that consent, the sponsor must submit—

\(a\) Adequate plans and specifications showing the nature and extent of the construction work to be performed under that force account;

\(b\) A schedule of the proposed construction and of the construction equipment that will be available for the project;

\(c\) Assurance that adequate labor, material, equipment, engineering personnel, as well as supervisory and inspection personnel as required by this appendix, will be provided; and

\(d\) A detailed estimate of the cost of the work, broken down for each class of costs involved, such as labor, materials, rental of equipment, and other pertinent items of cost.

15\. *Each sponsor shall*—

\(a\) Include the equal opportunity clause required by 41 CFR 60-1.4(b) in each nonexempt construction contract and subcontract;

\(b\) Prior to the award of each nonexempt contract, require each prime contractor and subcontractor to submit the certification required by 41 CFR 60-1.8(b);

\(c\) Include the Notice of Requirement for Affirmative Action to Ensure Equal Employment Opportunity (Executive Order 11246) required by 41 CFR 60-4.2 in all solicitations for offers and bids on each nonexempt construction contract and subcontract;

\(d\) Include the Standard Federal Equal Employment Opportunity Construction Contract Specifications (Executive Order 11246) required by 41 CFR 60-4.3(a) in each nonexempt construction contract and subcontract.

16\. *Exceptions.* (a) Paragraphs 1 through 5 and paragraphs 9 through 13 of this section do not apply to contracts with the owners of airport hazards, buildings, pipelines, powerlines, or other structures or facilities, for installing, extending, changing, removing, or relocating any of those structures or facilities. However, the sponsor must obtain the approval of the appropriate FAA office before entering into such a contract.

\(b\) Any oral or written agreement or understanding between a sponsor and another public agency that is not a sponsor of the project, under which that public agency undertakes construction work for or as agent of the sponsor, is not considered to be a construction contract for the purposes of this appendix.

\[Doc. No. 19430, 45 FR 34796, May 22, 1980\]

16\. *Federal Fair Labor Standards Act.* It will comply with the minimum wage and maximum hours provisions of the Federal Fair Labor Standards Act, as they apply to hospital and eduational institution employees of State and local governments.

17\. *Effective date and duration.* These covenants shall become effective upon acceptance by the sponsor of an offer of Federal aid for the Project or any portion thereof, made by the FAA and shall constitute a part of the Grant Agreement thus formed. These covenants shall remain in full force and effect throughout the useful life of the facilities developed under this Project, but in any event not to exceed twenty (20) years from the date of said acceptance of an offer of Federal aid for the Project. However, these limitations on the duration of the covenants do not apply to the covenant against exclusive rights and real property acquired with Federal funds. Any breach of these covenants on the part of the sponsor may result in the suspension or termination of, or refusal to grant Federal assistance under, FAA administered programs, or such other action which may be necessary to enforce the rights of the United States under this agreement.

18\. *Conditions and limitations on airport use.* The Sponsor will operate the Airport as such for the use and benefit of the public. In furtherance of this covenant (but without limiting its general applicability and effect), the Sponsor specifically agrees that it will keep the Airport open to all types, kinds, and classes of aeronautical use on fair and reasonable terms without discrimination between such types, kinds, and classes. *Provided,* that the sponsor may establish such fair, equal, and not unjustly discriminatory conditions to be met by all users of the airport as may be necessary for the safe and efficient operation of the Airport; and *Provided further,* That the Sponsor may prohibit or limit any given type, kind, or class of aeronautical use of the Airport if such action is necessary for the safe operation of the Airport or necessary to serve the civil aviation needs of the public.

19\. *Exclusive right.* The Sponsor—

a\. Will not grant or permit any exclusive right forbidden by Section 308(a) of the Federal Aviation Act of 1958 (49 U.S.C. 1349(a)) at the Airport, or at any other airport now owned or controlled by it;

b\. Agrees that, in furtherance of the policy of the FAA under this covenant, unless authorized by the Administrator, it will not, either directly or indirectly, grant or permit any person, firm or corporation the exclusive right at the Airport, or at any other airport now owned or controlled by it, to conduct any aeronautical activities, including, but not limited to charter flights, pilot training, aircraft rental and sightseeing, aerial photography, crop dusting, aerial advertising and surveying, air carrier operations, aircraft sales and services, sale of aviation petroleum products whether or not conducted in conjunction with other aeronautical activity, repair and maintenance of aircraft, sale of aircraft parts, and any other activities which because of their direct relationship to the operation of aircraft can be regarded as an aeronautical activity.

c\. Agrees that it will terminate any existing exclusive right to engage in the sale of gasoline or oil, or both, granted before July 17, 1962, at such an airport, at the earliest renewal, cancellation, or expiration date applicable to the agreement that established the exclusive right; and

d\. Agrees that it will terminate any other exclusive right to conduct an aeronautical activity now existing at such an airport before the grant of any assistance under the Airport and Airway Development Act.

20\. *Public use and benefit.* The Sponsor agrees that it will operate the Airport for the use and benefit of the public, on fair and reasonable terms, and without unjust discrimination. In furtherance of the covenant (but without limiting its general applicability and effect), the Sponsor specifically covenants and agrees:

a\. That in its operation and the operation of all facilities on the Airport, neither it nor any person or organization occupying space or facilities thereon will discriminate against any person or class of persons by reason of race, color, creed, or national origin in the use of any of the facilities provided for the public on the Airport.

b\. That in any agreement, contract, lease or other arrangement under which a right or privilege at the Airport is granted to any person, firm, or corporation to conduct or engage in any aeronautical activity for furnishing services to the public at the Airport, the Sponsor will insert and enforce provisions requiring the contractor—

\(1\) To furnish said service on a fair, equal, and not unjustly discriminatory basis to all users thereof, and

\(2\) To charge fair, reasonable, and not unjustly discriminatory prices for each unit or service; Provided, That the contractor may be allowed to make reasonable and nondiscriminatory discounts, rebates, or other similar types of price reductions to volume purchasers.

c\. That it will not exercise or grant any right or privilege which would operate to prevent any person, firm or corporation operating aircraft on the Airport from performing any services on its own aircraft with its own employees (including, but not limited to maintenance and repair) that it may choose to perform.

d\. In the event the Sponsor itself exercises any of the rights and privileges referred to in subsection b, the services involved will be provided on the same conditions as would apply to the furnishing of such services by contractors or concessionaires of the Sponsor under the provisions of such subsection b.

21\. *Nonaviation activities.* Nothing contained herein shall be construed to prohibit the granting or exercise of an exclusive right for the furnishing of nonaviation products and supplies or any service of a nonaeronautical nature or to obligate the Sponsor to furnish any particular nonaeronautical service at the Airport.

22\. *Operation and maintenance of the airport.* The Sponsor will operate and maintain in a safe and serviceable condition the Airport and all facilities thereon and connected therewith which are necessary to serve the aeronautical users of the Airport other than facilities owned or controlled by the United States, and will not permit any activity thereon which would interfere with its use for airport purposes; *Provided,* That nothing contained herein shall be construed to require that the Airport be operated for aeronautical uses during temporary periods when snow, flood, or other climatic conditions interfere with such operation and maintenance; and *Provided further,* That nothing herein shall be construed as requiring the maintenance, repair, restoration or replacement of any structure or facility which is substantially damaged or destroyed due to an act of God or other condition or circumstance beyond the control of the Sponsor. In furtherance of this covenant the sponsor will have in effect at all times arrangements for—

a\. Operating the airport's aeronautical facilities whenever required;

b\. Promptly marking and lighting hazards resulting from airport conditions, including temporary conditions; and

c\. Promptly notifying airmen of any condition affecting aeronautical use of the Airport.

23\. *Airport Hazards.* Insofar as it is within its power and reasonable, the Sponsor will, either by the acquisition and retention of easements or other interests in or rights for the use of land or airspace or by the adoption and enforcement of zoning regulations, prevent the construction, erection, alteration, or growth of any structure, tree, or other object in the approach areas of the runways of the Airport, which would constitute an airport hazard.

In addition, the Sponsor will not erect or permit the erection of any permanent structure or facility which would interfere materially with the use, operation, or future development of the Airport, in any portion of a runway approach area in which the Sponsor has acquired, or hereafter acquires, property interests permitting it to so control the use made of the surface of the land.

24\. *Use of adjacent land.* Insofar as it is within its power and reasonable, the Sponsor will, either by the acquisition and retention of easements or other interests in or rights for the use of land or airspace or by the adoption and enforcement of zoning regulations, take action to restrict the use of land adjacent to or in the immediate vicinity of the Airport to activities and purposes compatible with normal airport operations including landing and takeoff of aircraft.

25\. *Airport layout plan.* The Sponsor will keep up to date at all times an airport layout plan of the Airport showing (1) boundaries of the Airport and all proposed additions thereto, together with the boundaries of all offsite areas owned or controlled by the Sponsor for airport purposes, and proposed additions thereto; (2) the location and nature of all existing and proposed airport facilities and structures (such as runways, taxiways, aprons, terminal buildings, hangars and roads), including all proposed extensions and reductions of existing airport facilities; and (3) the location of all existing and proposed nonaviation areas and of all existing improvements thereon. Such airport layout plan and each amendment, revision, or modification thereof, shall be subject to the approval of the FAA, which approval shall be evidenced by the signature of a duly authorized representative of the FAA on the face of the airport layout plan. The Sponsor will not make or permit any changes or alterations in the airport or in any of its facilities other than in conformity with the airport layout plan as so approved by the FAA, if such changes or alterations might adversely affect the safety, utility, or efficiency of the Airport.

26\. *Federal use of facilities.* All facilities of the Airport developed with Federal aid and all those usable for the landing and taking off of aircraft, will be available to the United States at all times, without charge, for use by government aircraft in common with other aircraft, except that if the use by government aircraft is substantial, a reasonable share, proportional to such use, of the cost of operating and maintaining facilities so used, may be charged. Unless otherwise determined by the FAA, or otherwise agreed to by the Sponsor and the using agency, substantial use of an airport by government aircraft will be considered to exist when operations of such aircraft are in excess of those which, in the opinion of the FAA, would unduly interfere with use of the landing area by other authorized aircraft, or during any calendar month that—

a\. Five (5) or more government aircraft are regularly based at the airport or on land adjacent thereto; or

b\. The total number of movements (counting each landing as a movement and each takeoff as a movement) of government aircraft is 300 or more, or the gross accumulative weight of government aircraft using the Airport (the total movements of government aircraft multiplied by gross certified weights of such aircraft) is in excess of five million pounds.

27\. *Areas for FAA Use.* Whenever so requested by the FAA, the Sponsor will furnish without cost to the Federal Government, for construction, operation, and maintenance of facilities for air traffic control activities, or weather reporting activities and communication activities related to air traffic control, such areas of land or water, or estate therein, or rights in buildings of the Sponsor as the FAA may consider necessary or desirable for construction at Federal expense of space or facilities for such purposes. The approximate amounts of areas and the nature of the property interests and/or rights so required will be set forth in the Grant Agreement relating to the project. Such areas or any portion thereof will be made available as provided herein within 4 months after receipt of written requests from the FAA.

28\. *Fee and rental structure.* The airport operator or owner will maintain a fee and rental structure for the facilities and services being provided the airport users which will make the Airport as self-sustaining as possible under the circumstances existing at the Airport, taking into account such factors as the volume of traffic and economy of collection.

29\. *Reports to FAA.* The Sponsor will furnish the FAA with such annual or special airport financial and operational reports as may be reasonably requested. Such reports may be submitted on forms furnished by the FAA, or may be submitted in such manner as the Sponsor elects so long as the essential data are furnished. The Airport and all airport records and documents affecting the Airport, including deeds, leases, operation and use agreements, regulations, and other instruments, will be made available of inspection and audit by the Secretary and the Comptroller General of the United States, or their duly authorized representatives, upon reasonable request. The Sponsor will furnish to the FAA or to the General Accounting Office, upon request, a true copy of any such document.

30\. *System of accounting.* All project accounts and records will be kept in accordance with a standard system of accounting if so prescribed by the Secretary.

31\. *Interfering right.* If at any time it is determined by the FAA that there is any outstanding right or claim of right in or to the Airport property, other than those set forth in Part II of the Application for Federal Assistance, the existence of which creates an undue risk of interference with the operation of the Airport or the performance of the covenants of this part, the sponsor will acquire, extinguish, or modify such right or claim of right in a manner acceptable to the FAA.

32\. *Performance obligation.* The Sponsor will not enter into any transaction which would operate to deprive it of any of the rights and powers necessary to perform any or all of the covenants made herein, unless by such transaction the obligation to perform all such covenants is assumed by another public agency found by the FAA to be eligible under the Act and Regulations to assume such obligations and having the power, authority, and financial resources to carry out all such obligations. If an arrangement is made for management or operation of the Airport by any agency or person other than the Sponsor or an employee of the Sponsor, the Sponsor will reserve sufficient rights and authority to insure that the Airport will be operated and maintained in accordance with the Act, the Regulations, and these covenants.

33\. *Meaning of terms.* Unless the context otherwise requires, all terms used in these covenants which are defined in the Act and the Regulations shall have the meanings assigned to them therein.

B. *Airport Layout Plan Approval.* A sponsor seeking FAA approval of a new or revised airport layout plan shall submit with the plan an environmental assessment prepared in conformance with Appendix 6 of FAA Order 1050.1C, “Policies and Procedures for Considering Environmental Impacts” (45 FR 2244; January 10, 1980) and FAA Order 5050.4 “Airport Environmental Handbook” (45 FR 56622; August 25, 1980), if an assessment is required by Order 5050.4.
